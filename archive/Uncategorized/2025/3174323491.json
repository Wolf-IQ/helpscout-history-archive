Project Pages- carousel navigation not always showing up for me- two screenshots here. As the images are dark and the button font is very fine, we need the navigation to show up in the white space within this banner (as in first image) to ensure good UX</em><br>\n    <br>\n    Can this indicator not come up immediately within the carousel? It's not immediately clear that you can actually scroll for more images, especially since you're always seeing three whole images. I have done a loom to explain. I'm fine for it to say 'next' on the central image<br>\n    When the user interacts with the carousel the next and previous appear straight away - see <a href=\"https://we.tl/t-j6qwzoOh20\">recording here</a>. If the text appears over the central image you'll have the same issue where the text will blend into the image.<br>\n    <br>\n    <em>5. Is the contact form/ newsletter attached to the correct Flodesk workflows? you should be getting a fairly instant flodesk email response from entering these- I have done so but don't think I have an email address that isn't already attached. Have you gotten responses from your testing? Which also calls to mind, does the form allow you to just put the project enquiry submissions to the Flodesk workflow? The press or careers entries do not need the same workflow response.</em><br>\n    Thank you for sending through the automation for the project enquiry workflow. That looks to be working as it should. However, did you get a response for the newsletter sign up? That should be immediate as well. Can you confirm the press/careers enquiries do not get put into this workflow?<br>\n    Yes, have forwarded this over to you.<br>\n    Confirming press and careers do not go into this workflow<br>\n    <br>\n    <em>6. Mobile: The hero image on mobile only seems to have a greyed out filter on it.</em><br>\n    This hasn't changed. The other images on the site have the same vibrancy as the desktop version. Also the spacing has changed on this page, there is now a lot more white space on mobile before the image starts. I prefer to keep the spacing as per the current mobile site.<br>\n    <br>\n    It appears because the file you supplied was 70mb it was being compressed to get down to a web res version. We've attached a smaller version projects@wolfiq.com.au can you please use the one attached for mobile only. Let us know when actioned.<br>\n    <br>\n    In terms of spacing - I've included screenshots below - this is our preferred spacing for mobile homepage now that it's a still image as the padding is evenly spaced. The transition is different from the live site so it is not exactly the same spacing as the current site.<br>\n    <br>\n    Lastly, I have noticed on desktop the spacing has changed on the contact page- it's missing some space at the top (see current site to compare) It needs a bit more breathing room from the header to the start of the Expressions of Interest- to align with the current site spacing<br>\n    projects@wolfiq.com.au can you please add the correct padding on the contact page under the navigation pls<br>\n    <br>\n    Staging:<br>\n    <br>\n    <img alt=\"IMG_7417.PNG\" width=\"259\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/02e665e3c241f66fa35ae7aa6f7258322149a1ce/a84f3dfd383712f144c0883053c5b8da289ad406/IMG_7417.png\"><br>\n    <br>\n    Live:<br>\n    <br>\n    <img alt=\"IMG_7418.PNG\" width=\"259\" height=\"562\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/6de04f8bc79634c6da1a21e5f4cd3d3147a6d849/c3d17b6a182b672dc28b4f16cd80272587c8e796/IMG_7418.png\">\n</p><div class=\"helpscout-signature\">\nKindest,<br>\nAmy<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Bandit business hours are Tuesday-Friday 8:30am-5pm.</strong><strong>Holiday closure: The studio will be closed Friday 19th, and will reopen Tuesday 6th of Jan.</strong><br>\n<br>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"136\" class=\"ex-c2\" src=\"https://signaturehound.com/api/v1/file/53mjzklo6sixkq\"><br>\n<br>\nAmy Hauber<br>\n<br>\nAccount Director<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"tel:+61466844555\">+ 61 466 844 555</a><br>\n<br>\nSuite 1, Level 2, 105 Crown Street,<br>\nDarlinghurst NSW 2010<br>\n@banditdesigngroup<br>\n<br>\nhttp://banditdesigngroup.com.au/<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://signaturehound.com/signature/cta/ixcmlhpsr612\"><img alt=\"\" width=\"309\" height=\"69\" class=\"ex-c16\" src=\"https://signaturehound.com/api/v1/file/cz4mlhpx69e8\"></a><br>\n<br>\nWe acknowledge the Gadigal People as the traditional owners<br>\nof the land in which we work and pay our respects to their Elders,<br>\npast, present and future.\n</div>",
