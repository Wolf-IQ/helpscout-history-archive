I'm a stroke survivor and work part time in the Woollahra Council Area.<br>\n<br>\nAfter completing the online application I received an email saying my documents could not be opened from the Welcome Mat platform and could I fill out another form. It takes a considerable amount of time to fill out online forms and prepared documents. Uploading very personal information is not a comfortable feeling. I was then sent another PDF form to fill out that was a totally different layout with different questions to the Welcome Mat platform.<br>\n<br>\nI spoke to Belinda who confirmed that she received my documents and tried to explain to me how the process works. My income was under the threshold but I had to earn more? It was very confusing, I could afford the rent advertised. I am a sole trader so I don't neatly fit into the PAYG category. Neither the WHC or Welcome Mat caters for freelance workers.<br>\n<br>\nI followed up weekly to see if there was anything else that would help my application.<br>\n<br>\nI finally got notification from Welcome Mat that I was unsuccessful. I was very disappointed and wanted to find out more about how people are selected and if there was a reason I was overlooked. I asked for feedback to help me with future applications.<br>\n<br>\nI thought that the response below was insensitive, cold and not in keeping with the ethos of what WHC is about.<br>\nI sent some very sensitive, personal information to WHC and Welcome Mat. I would have liked to have received a more professional response as to management feedback and answer my question about other units in the building.<br>\n<br>\nYours sincerely<br>\nMichelle Seth<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nHi Belinda<br>\nIs it possible to find out why I was unsuccessful for future reference?<br>\nDo you have studios in the building.<br>\nAppreciate any feedback<br>\nRegards<br>\nMichelle<br>\n<br>\nHello Michelle,<br>\n<br>\nWe have had a successful applicant. After getting feedback from management they have decided to go with another applicant.<br>\n<br>\nThank you<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nKind regards<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nBelinda Messina<br>\nCustomer Service Officer - Customer Services<br>\nMonday, Tuesday and Wednesday<br>\nOffice: 02 9281 1764<br>\nwww.womenshousingcompany.org</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<span><img src=\"https://0r83ql3rzy0lzw1j.click.mailersend.net/tl/ows/eyJpdiI6ImZiSjczaDFGajI3bktnWWEwd0pROXc9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoiRWVMblVZdGMzSzdUMTVsbXgrTWN5NmFlTU96bmtzS1pMSnhvcExLNk9rQmI0bHI1Q0JsMXlPdmEzZVlQY2FLdWMvSWhSTXVjTXprOGlLMG4vMC9FMUZ5cDR1czB5MjhTd3MwbVd4TVNtSjQ9IiwibWFjIjoiZTYzMmZkN2ZmYTgwNjFhOTc2MjcyMWM1OWRiOGZlZGE5MGEwZTY3MDFlOTM2OTRjMzg3Nzc3MzI0NDM5ZGE4ZCIsInRhZyI6IiJ9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" style=\"height:0px;width:0px;max-width:0px;max-height:0px;\" border=\"0\" /></span>",
