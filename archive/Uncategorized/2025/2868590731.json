I have just have come out of hospital the week before for a health scare. I didn't recognize the number and I have never spoken with Dimitra before. When I answered the phone she introduced her self and quickly started yelling at me \" your arrears are skyrocketing and \"I will be filing an application to NCAT\" and \"you didn't respond to my email in December\". I was very agitated as I felt l was been attacked. I told her I had a health scare and have been unwell , her tone changed to somewhat disrespectful. I felt ambushed, dismissed, disregarded and pressured. In order to diffuse the situation, I told Dimitra to speak to my Tenancy Advocate. The Innerwest Advocacy Tenants Service (Maralyn) contacted Dimitra via email explaining she did in fact send her an email in December clarifying she will be on leave and will contact her asap and that in the mean time we were checking our records to see if the outstanding arrears (which Dimitra acknowledged was an error on WHC's part) matched Dimitra's. The next day Dimitra filed for NCAT.<br>\nIn the mean time I have been corresponding with Auriane and Kelly Daniels about my current health issues and rent arrears as well as no longer feeling comfortable working with Dimitra. On 6th March I spoke to Auriane via telephone and told her that I will submitting a complaint against Dimitra on the WHC's website.<br>\nI would like to reiterate that I have always communicated information across to WHC in a timely manner, unfortunately, due to multiple staff changes within the organizsation I have been left in the dark about a few things which at times meant I didn't have a Tenancy Manager or manager.<br>\n<br>\nDimitra's behavior has made me feel further vulnerable, distressed and unheard and It has led me to lose trust in the same organization that supposedly houses, protects and empowers vulnerable women. I also question WHC's duty of care.<br>\n<br>\nI trust you will look into the matter and take appropriate action.<br>\n<br>\nRegards,<br>\nClaudia Ayache<br>\n4/2B Market St Drummoyne 2047</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<span><img src=\"https://0r83ql3rzy0lzw1j.click.mailersend.net/tl/ows/eyJpdiI6IlZXUFVsVHdueUZxSGRkSm1wdzBMQUE9PSIsInZhbHVlIjoiSjFXeDhvanVSeGtxS2h1T213c2hWKzdyYkFkU0RKQnVUWFU4OEMzQkg3OVlzOHhaMSt4a1dNbFlsYncwckJqYy9XZUxRUGtMb3UvL01PZ1pralBwS0xQRmFyMjFpRnJad2Uyd3lTTUQyWWs9IiwibWFjIjoiMzM4Mzk1YTY4ZGU3ODIwMWQzZDM2ZjhhMTM5ZTZiYTBjNjc2ZWY0NmQ3YzZiOGVkYjM5ODdkM2ZjMTRiYzc4NSIsInRhZyI6IiJ9\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" style=\"height:0px;width:0px;max-width:0px;max-height:0px;\" border=\"0\" /></span>",
