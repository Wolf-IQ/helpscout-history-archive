As your site is built on WordPress, we can implement this using <strong>Gravity Forms</strong>, which supports secure file uploads.<br><br><h3>1. Upload Functionality</h3>Yes, we can add an upload field to your existing contact form to allow clients and referring doctors to submit <strong>PDF, JPEG, PNG,</strong> or other approved file types along with their referral. The uploaded document can be delivered directly as an email attachment to your nominated inbox. We can also restrict file size and type to maintain performance and security.<br><br><h3>2. Data Protection During Upload/Transmission</h3>Gravity Forms can be configured to:<br><ul><li><strong>Use SSL/HTTPS encryption</strong> during upload to ensure files are encrypted in transit.<br></li><li><strong>Avoid long-term storage</strong> on the server by delivering files directly via email (or deleting them automatically after delivery).<br></li><li>If temporary storage is required, ensure it is protected by <strong>server-level access restrictions</strong> and <strong>automatic cleanup</strong>.<br></li></ul><br><h3>3.

Email Handling &amp; Form Fields</h3>Could you please confirm what will happen to the referral emails once they are received in your inbox? For example, will they be stored long-term, printed, or forwarded internally? This will help us ensure the workflow remains fully compliant with privacy requirements.<br><br>In addition, could you send us the specific fields you would like included in the contact form? If they are standard fields (e.g., name, phone, email, message, file upload), setup will be straightforward. If the form includes more complex conditional logic or custom data capture, this may require additional configuration.<br><br><h3>5. Cost Estimate</h3>Our estimate for implementation, testing, and privacy configuration is <strong>1\u20134 hours</strong> depending on the complexity of the form fields and any additional email conditions.<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions, we are always happy to answer<br>",

            "body": "Good afternoon Natalie,<br><br>Thank you so much for your enquiry, we completely understand the importance of protecting sensitive health information, and we\u2019re happy to advise you on how this can be safely and legally implemented on your website.<br><br>Please see our responses below:<br><br><h3><strong>1. Is it possible to add an upload function to the contact form?</strong></h3>Yes, absolutely. We can add an <strong>upload field</strong> to your homepage contact form, allowing users such as clients or referring doctors, to securely attach referral documents (e.g., PDFs, JPEGs, PNGs). These will be sent along with the form submission and received safely by your team.<br><br><h3><strong>2. How is the data protected during upload and transmission?</strong></h3>Security is a top priority, especially when dealing with health-related information. Here\u2019s how the data is protected:<br><ul><li><strong>Encrypted Transmission (HTTPS):</strong> Your site already uses HTTPS, meaning all information (including file uploads) is encrypted during transfer and cannot be intercepted in transit.<br></li><li><strong>Restricted Access to Uploaded Files:</strong> We configure uploads so they are <strong>not publicly accessible</strong>. Only authorised users (your admin team) will be able to view or download the documents.<br></li><li><strong>Ongoing Monitoring and Updates:</strong> Your website is managed under a care plan that includes <strong>BlogVault</strong>, which ensures that all security patches and plugin updates are applied promptly. BlogVault also monitors for any suspicious activity and keeps daily backups.<br></li><li>We can't save specific emails data since it goes through the specific email set-up by that form<br></li></ul><br><h3><strong>3. Where is the uploaded data stored? Is it based in Australia?</strong></h3>Yes , your site is hosted with <strong>Kinsta</strong>, which uses <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong>. We have confirmed that:<br><ul><li>Your website\u2019s data , including any uploaded documents , is hosted in <strong>Google Cloud\u2019s Sydney data centre</strong>, meaning all data remains <strong>within Australia</strong>.<br></li><li>Google Cloud complies with the <strong>Australian Privacy Act 1988</strong> and the <strong>Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)</strong>, covering how sensitive information must be collected, used, and stored.<br></li></ul>For additional reassurance:<br><ul><li>\ud83d\udcc4 <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google_cloud_australian_privacy_principles.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Google Cloud\u2019s APP Compliance Summary (PDF)</a><br></li><li>\ud83c\udf10 <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/compliance\">Google Cloud Compliance Overview</a><br></li></ul>Cloudflare is also used as part of your site\u2019s infrastructure, but it does <strong>not store uploaded files</strong>. It only assists with performance and security, without affecting the storage location of sensitive data.<br><br><h3>4. What is the cost to implement this feature?</h3>We estimate, this will take us 2-4 hour depending on how complicated the form is. If you can send us the necessary fields we can know how long it would take: <br><ul><li>Add and configure the secure upload field<br></li><li>Set appropriate file size and type restrictions<br></li><li>Configure secure file access rules<br></li><li>Test the form to ensure safe delivery and handling of referrals<br></li></ul>All regular updates such as plugins and security monitoring are already covered under your existing care plan.<br>",
