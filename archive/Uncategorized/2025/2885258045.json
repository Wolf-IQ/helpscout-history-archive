Just so we're clear - does adding an email as a collaborator ensure that they receive the same maintenance reports we send to our clients, including the PDF attachments?<br>\n    <br>\n    My concern is that this setup might only notify the collaborator of inbound emails (emails we receive) rather than outbound emails (reports we send to clients). Our goal is for a specific email address to receive these reports exactly as if they were BCC'd on the original email to the client.<br>\n    <br>\n    Can you confirm if this is how it works, or if there's a different way to achieve this?\n</p><div class=\"helpscout-signature\">\nThanks,<br>\nDaphne\n</div>",

Our goal isn't just to track report emails in HubSpot but to establish a deeper integration between BlogVault and HubSpot.<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Specifically, we'd like HubSpot to automatically log BlogVault activities for the relevant contact/company.</strong><br>\n    For example, when a plugin update is completed via BlogVault, we want HubSpot to recognize this and update the corresponding record. This would help us maintain a more comprehensive activity history within HubSpot.<br>\n    <br>\n    Does BlogVault offer any direct integration with HubSpot for this kind of workflow, or is there an API we can use to set up this automation?<br>\n    <br>\n    Looking forward to your insights.\n</p><div class=\"helpscout-signature\">\nThanks again,<br>\nDaphne\n</div>",

Thanks for the great service.</div>\n<div><br>\nWe use HubSpot as our CRM, and need to track the Blogvault reporting emails going out to our customers in the CRM.</div>\n<div> <br>\nTo this, we think the best path is to update our maintenance report email setup and need your help with the following:</div>\n<div>\n<ol>\n<li>Automatic BCC for Internal Tracking - Currently, Blogvault sends maintenance report emails to our customers on their scheduled cadence (monthly, quarterly, annual). We are thinking to get need every report email to also be automatically BCC'd to <a href=\"mailto:sample@wolfiq.com.au\">sample@wolfiq.com.au</a>. Is there a way to configure this at the system level so we don't have to add the BCC manually for each customer?</li>\n<li>HubSpot Integration - Do Blogvault emails already structure this information in a way that supports HubSpot tracking, or is there a way to configure this?</li>\n</ol>\nPlease let us know if these configurations are possible or if any adjustments are needed.<br>\nLooking forward to your response.<br>\n<br></div>\n<div>Thanks!<br></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<span class=\"ex-gmail_signature_prefix\">--</span><br>\n<div class=\"helpscout-signature\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\" class=\"ex-gmail_signature\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left:0pt;\" align=\"left\">\n<table style=\"border:none;border-collapse:collapse;\">\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"208\" />\n<col width=\"17\" />\n<col width=\"209\" /></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:162.8310546875pt;\">\n<td style=\"border-left:solid #ffffff 1pt;border-right:solid #ffffff 1pt;border-bottom:solid #ffffff 1pt;border-top:solid #ffffff 1pt;vertical-align:top;padding:5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;\"><span style=\"border:none;width:194px;height:195px;\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdJv-Nl90CBv0Stp1myeEaO4nsVbp-262RaDWIVMzroNQugoi8oEar36w_TVkNvT7QWhZuFOp2JyxrIFoNp3mCKL8NCLOyC5-qjvfIvhEiY1rFyGThmN30qMgoxZlf5DPZpCryaFw?key=vF0KdVV6_CANQIYvdY_GOAVP\" width=\"194\" height=\"195\" style=\"margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;\" alt=\"AD_4nXdJv-Nl90CBv0Stp1myeEaO4nsVbp-262RaDWIVMzroNQugoi8oEar36w_TVkNvT7QWhZuFOp2JyxrIFoNp3mCKL8NCLOyC5-qjvfIvhEiY1rFyGThmN30qMgoxZlf5DPZpCryaFw?key=vF0KdVV6_CANQIYvdY_GOAVP\" /></span></span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"border-left:solid #ffffff 1pt;border-right:solid #ffffff 1pt;border-bottom:solid #ffffff 1pt;border-top:solid #ffffff 1pt;vertical-align:top;padding:5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt;\"><br></td>\n<td style=\"border-left:solid #ffffff 1pt;border-right:solid #ffffff 1pt;border-bottom:solid #ffffff 1pt;border-top:solid #ffffff 1pt;vertical-align:top;padding:5pt 5pt 5pt 5pt;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:18pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;vertical-align:baseline;\">Daphne Bautista</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;\">Operations Manager</span></p>\n<br>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;\"><span style=\"border:none;width:114px;height:28px;\"><img src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeET7FSi5KtuXONfu2hwmgV4eAI-DD2kzzxiigv0dQnRjr7WrCiTTn5u2oS84a8fpoqUpr98gw4PyisoK1g-0zhJa9Q8KuGmiR1kbCYr-mUd3kyOsJC2ud-lm1c7_JPzM79lkvrYA?key=vF0KdVV6_CANQIYvdY_GOAVP\" width=\"114\" height=\"28\" style=\"margin-left:0px;margin-top:0px;\" alt=\"AD_4nXeET7FSi5KtuXONfu2hwmgV4eAI-DD2kzzxiigv0dQnRjr7WrCiTTn5u2oS84a8fpoqUpr98gw4PyisoK1g-0zhJa9Q8KuGmiR1kbCYr-mUd3kyOsJC2ud-lm1c7_JPzM79lkvrYA?key=vF0KdVV6_CANQIYvdY_GOAVP\" /></span></span></p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;\">\u260e +63 907 043 3011</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;vertical-align:baseline;\">\u2709 <a href=\"mailto:daphne@wolfiq.com.au\">daphne@wolfiq.com.au</a> </span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
