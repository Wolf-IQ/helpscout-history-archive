Account Management:*<br><br>I mentioned to Madeleine yesterday about our New Director, Andy Crebar,<br>cc'd in. I can't recall if I mentioned this to you. I was quite focused on<br>the issue at hand, so it may have escaped me.<br><br>Some background context, ahead of our official communications due to be<br>sent out in the coming days/week(s). Andy has joined Wolf IQ as our new<br>Director, or 'Leader of the Pack' as the team has coined him. Andy will be<br>heading up all of our client-facing communications with the team. I will be<br>taking on a more behind the scenes roll. Andy has an incredible amount of<br>experience and will be growing our service offering and team accordingly.<br><br>All of my emails and phone calls are now being directed to Andy so that he<br>can take action or forward on the requests. Needless to say, it appears<br>that this has resulted in a delay for Little Scribblers. So please accept<br>mine and Andy's apology. The changes at our side of things are vast as we<br>wade through a decade of client account management from my end. But, of<br>course, this should not affect our clients.<br><br>Moving forward, you can send all requests to Andy and cc me in. Andy is<br>also manning my old mobile number and our main line: 1300 072 134. However,<br>if you are ever stuck and can't reach Andy, my personal mobile number is *0466<br>832 740. *I'll be able to jump in and help for urgent needs.
