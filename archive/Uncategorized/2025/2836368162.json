Neglect and Lack of Response:<br>\nEmma, as Celeste's property manager, consistently ignored her concerns, failed to take responsibility for the issues in her tenancy, and took no meaningful action to rectify them.<br>\nMultiple requests for urgent assistance, including those concerning health and safety risks, were disregarded.<br>\n<br>\n2. Mould and Structural Defects:<br>\nCeleste has been exposed to unsafe living conditions due to significant mould growth, inadequate ventilation, and structural damage, all of which were not disclosed to her upon moving in.<br>\nReports now confirm pre-existing issues with the property, including previous water damage and repairs that should have been disclosed.<br>\n<br>\n3. Failure to Protect Tenant's Belongings:<br>\nWomen's Housing facilitated mould remediation works without ensuring proper protection of Celeste's belongings. Her furniture and personal items were exposed to mould spores, rendering them unsafe.<br>\nMaggie has refused to take responsibility, instead suggesting tenant's insurance should cover the loss, despite the clear failure of WHC to safeguard her property.<br>\n<br>\n4. Unlawful Water Charging Practices:<br>\nCeleste has been charged for water usage under a unit share arrangement without itemised invoices or proper breakdowns of her individual usage.<br>\nWHC has benefited from unit entitlements but has still passed the costs onto tenants, which contradicts Hunter Water regulations and fair billing practices.<br>\n<br>\n5. Failure to Provide Suitable Housing:<br>\nWhen the property became uninhabitable, WHC initially refused to assist Celeste in securing alternative accommodation.<br>\nAnother organisation had to intervene to provide temporary housing in a hotel, which WHC later took over briefly before again refusing further assistance.<br>\nCeleste was ultimately left with no option but to sleep in a tent with her child, highlighting a complete disregard for her welfare.<br>\nWHC has failed to offer any long-term housing solutions, forcing Celeste into a refuge with four other families despite her continued rent payments.<br>\n<br>\nRequested Actions:<br>\nA full investigation into the handling of Celeste's tenancy, including Emma's inaction and Maggie's refusal to take responsibility.<br>\nA written explanation of why these failures occurred and what corrective measures WHC will take.<br>\n<br>\nReimbursement or compensation for Celeste's loss of belongings due to WHC's negligence in the remediation process.<br>\n<br>\nAn immediate review of WHC's water charging practices to ensure compliance with regulations.<br>\n<br>\nAn urgent reassessment of Celeste's housing situation to provide her with safe and suitable accommodation.<br>\n<br>\nThis level of mismanagement and neglect is unacceptable, and if WHC does not take swift action to address these failures, the matter will be escalated further. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and provide a formal response outlining the steps WHC intends to take.<br>\n<br>\nSincerely,<br>\nAshleigh foodey<br>\nOn behalf of Celeste mordaunt</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>",
