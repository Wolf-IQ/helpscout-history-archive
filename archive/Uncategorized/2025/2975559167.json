Go to the form\u2019s settings.<br>2. Under **\"Actions After Submit\"**, add **\"JavaScript\"**.<br>3. In the JavaScript field, insert this snippet (update the `formName` to something unique per form):<br><br>document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(\"elementor_form_submitted\", {<br>detail: {<br>formId: '{{ID}}',<br>formName: 'Contact Form', // Change this label per form<br>pageURL: window.location.href // Optional, tracks the page location<br>}<br>}));<br><br>Repeat this for each form you'd like to track, updating the `formName` value accordingly.<br><br><br>### \u2705 Step 2: Create a Custom Event Trigger in GTM<br><br>1. In GTM, go to **Triggers &gt; New**.<br>2. Set trigger type as **Custom Event**.<br>3. Event Name: `elementor_form_submitted` .<br>4. Trigger on **All Custom Events** (or filter by form ID later if needed).<br><br><br>### \u2705 Step 3: Create Data Layer Variables<br>Create the following variables in GTM to extract form data:<br><br>- `event_detail_formId` \u2192 Data Layer Variable: `event.detail.formId`<br>- `event_detail_formName` \u2192 Data Layer Variable: `event.detail.formName`<br>- `event_detail_pageURL` \u2192 Data Layer Variable: `event.detail.pageURL`_(optional)_<br><br><br>### \u2705 Step 4: Set Up GA4 Event Tag in GTM<br><br>1.

Form Details**<br>For each form you'd like tracked, please send:<br><br>- The **form name** you\u2019ve used in GTM (i.e. the value in the `formName` field like `\"Contact Form\"` or `\"Quote Request\"` ).<br>- The **URL** of the page where that form appears.<br>**2. GTM Trigger Summary**<br>Please confirm:<br><br>- That the **Custom Event Trigger** is named `elementor_form_submitted` .<br>- Any filters you've added (e.g. specific pages or form IDs), if applicable.<br>**3. GA4 Tag Overview (Optional but helpful)**<br><br>- The name of the **GA4 Event Tag** you created.<br>- The **parameters** you're sending (e.g. `form_name` , `form_id` , `page_url` ).<br>- Your **GA4 Measurement ID**, in case you'd like assistance testing the setup.<br>**4.

Go to the form\u2019s settings.<br>2. Under **\"Actions After Submit\"**, add **\"JavaScript\"**.<br>3. In the JavaScript field, insert this snippet (update the `formName` to something unique per form):<br><br>document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(\"elementor_form_submitted\", {<br>detail: {<br>formId: '{{ID}}',<br>formName: 'Contact Form', // Change this label per form<br>pageURL: window.location.href // Optional, tracks the page location<br>}<br>}));<br><br>Repeat this for each form you'd like to track, updating the `formName` value accordingly.<br><br><br>### \u2705 Step 2: Create a Custom Event Trigger in GTM<br><br>1. In GTM, go to **Triggers &gt; New**.<br>2. Set trigger type as **Custom Event**.<br>3. Event Name: `elementor_form_submitted` .<br>4. Trigger on **All Custom Events** (or filter by form ID later if needed).<br><br><br>### \u2705 Step 3: Create Data Layer Variables<br>Create the following variables in GTM to extract form data:<br><br>- `event_detail_formId` \u2192 Data Layer Variable: `event.detail.formId`<br>- `event_detail_formName` \u2192 Data Layer Variable: `event.detail.formName`<br>- `event_detail_pageURL` \u2192 Data Layer Variable: `event.detail.pageURL`_(optional)_<br><br><br>### \u2705 Step 4: Set Up GA4 Event Tag in GTM<br><br>1. Go to **Tags &gt; New** and create a **GA4 Event Tag**.<br>2. Select your existing GA4 Configuration Tag.<br>3. Set **Event Name** to: `form_submission` .<br>Add Event Parameters:<br><br>- `form_id` \u2192 `{{event_detail_formId}}`<br>- `form_name` \u2192 `{{event_detail_formName}}`<br>- `page_url` \u2192 `{{event_detail_pageURL}}`_(optional)_<br>Attach the **Custom Event Trigger** you created earlier.<br><br><br>### \u2705 Step 5: Test the Setup<br><br>- Use GTM\u2019s **Preview Mode** to test form submissions.<br>Submit each Elementor form and verify:<br><br>- The correct event is triggered in GTM.<br>- Parameters such as `form_name` populate properly.<br>- Use **GA4 DebugView** or **Realtime reports** to confirm events are received.<br><br><br><br>Thanks,<br><br>**Joel Maligalig**<br>support@wolfiq.com.au<br><br>![wolfiq.com.au](https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/1m3NYUuXtUVyZ313zB6byGDnpd4zEEcb2=w3024-h1646-iv2)<br>**Impressed with our service?
