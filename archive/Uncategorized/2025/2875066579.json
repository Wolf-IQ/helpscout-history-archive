Form updates - done :)*<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Firstly, let me say that the new form is up and running. If you click the<br>&gt; enquire buttons throughout the site, you will see the shortened form. We<br>&gt; have kept the old layout there, just hidden from the public for now. Can<br>&gt; you please confirm that we are sending the form submissions to the correct<br>&gt; email addresses? It's currently set up like this:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; *enrol@littlescribblers.com.au &lt;enrol@littlescribblers.com.au&gt;:*<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Ashfield<br>&gt;    - Belmore - Cleary Avenue<br>&gt;    - Belmore - Benaroon Road<br>&gt;    - Beaconsfield<br>&gt;    - Brookvale<br>&gt;    - Caringbah<br>&gt;    - Dingley<br>&gt;    - Mooroolbark, Birchwood Drive<br>&gt;<br>&gt; *bondsroadsupervisor@littlescribblers.com.au<br>&gt; &lt;bondsroadsupervisor@littlescribblers.com.au&gt;*<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Peakhurst - Bonds Road<br>&gt;<br>&gt; *peakhurstsupervisor@littlescribblers.com.au<br>&gt; &lt;peakhurstsupervisor@littlescribblers.com.au&gt;*<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Peakhurst - Belmore Road<br>&gt;<br>&gt; *sutherlandsupervisor@littlescribblers.com.au<br>&gt; &lt;sutherlandsupervisor@littlescribblers.com.au&gt;*<br>&gt;<br>&gt;    - Sutherland<br>&gt;<br>&gt; *2. Account Management:*<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I mentioned to Madeleine yesterday about our New Director, Andy Crebar,<br>&gt; cc'd in. I can't recall if I mentioned this to you. I was quite focused on<br>&gt; the issue at hand, so it may have escaped me.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Some background context, ahead of our official communications due to be<br>&gt; sent out in the coming days/week(s). Andy has joined Wolf IQ as our new<br>&gt; Director, or 'Leader of the Pack' as the team has coined him. Andy will be<br>&gt; heading up all of our client-facing communications with the team. I will be<br>&gt; taking on a more behind the scenes roll. Andy has an incredible amount of<br>&gt; experience and will be growing our service offering and team accordingly.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; All of my emails and phone calls are now being directed to Andy so that<br>&gt; he can take action or forward on the requests. Needless to say, it appears<br>&gt; that this has resulted in a delay for Little Scribblers. So please accept<br>&gt; mine and Andy's apology. The changes at our side of things are vast as we<br>&gt; wade through a decade of client account management from my end. But, of<br>&gt; course, this should not affect our clients.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Moving forward, you can send all requests to Andy and cc me in. Andy is<br>&gt; also manning my old mobile number and our main line: 1300 072 134. However,<br>&gt; if you are ever stuck and can't reach Andy, my personal mobile number is *0466<br>&gt; 832 740. *I'll be able to jump in and help for urgent needs. Just don't<br>&gt; share my number around please haha.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I'm standing by if any updates are required on the new form. Please call<br>&gt; me or SMS as I won't be at my computer.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Again, thanks for your understanding.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Heath<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On Sat, Mar 8, 2025 at 9:11\u202fAM Andy Crebar &lt;andy@wolfiq.com.au&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; ---------- Forwarded message ---------<br>&gt;&gt; From: Jackie Daniels &lt;jackie@littlescribblers.com.au&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Date: Sat, Mar 8, 2025 at 7:44\u202fAM<br>&gt;&gt; Subject: URGENT Website<br>&gt;&gt; To: Heath Maguire Wolf IQ &lt;heath@wolfiq.com.au&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Cc: Emad Ibrahim &lt;emad@littlescribblers.com.au&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Heath,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; We\u2019re a little disappointed as we had a great conversation on Friday<br>&gt;&gt; morning, and have t heard back from you.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; The changes were emailed to you within 30min, and you promised these<br>&gt;&gt; would be done.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; We are now into Saturday and the changes haven\u2019t been done nor have we<br>&gt;&gt; been able to contact you or anyone else from your organisation.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; It was so important that this was done before cob yesterday.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Jackie<br>&gt;&gt; Kind Regards,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; *Director*<br>&gt;&gt; Little Scribblers Kindergarten<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; *HEAD OFFICE - Centre of Excellence*<br>&gt;&gt; 106 Russell Avenue<br>&gt;&gt; Dolls Point NSW 2219<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; M: 0448 619 864<br>&gt;&gt; HO: 1300 300 011<br>&gt;&gt; E: Jackie@littlescribblers.com.au<br>&gt;&gt; Web:  www.littlescribblers.com.a<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; On 6 Mar 2025, at 7:38\u202fpm, Jackie Daniels &lt;<br>&gt;&gt; jackie@littlescribblers.com.au&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; \ufeffHeath,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I really really need you to spend some time going through our website<br>&gt;&gt; with a fine tooth and comb.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; I need to know it is doing what it needs to, unfortunately looking at<br>&gt;&gt; our data we seem to have less and less enquiries.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; We have 8+ locations and we sometimes have almost 0 enquiries.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Our business is going backwards and we need something to change<br>&gt;&gt; significantly, and I really believe something is definitely not right.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Today I tested it and \u201cbook a tour\u201d doesn\u2019t work.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Heath I can\u2019t begin to tell you how critical the situation is and how<br>&gt;&gt; important it is that you make sure it is set up correctly and working at it<br>&gt;&gt; optimal.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; SEO is definitely not something to look at now<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; Kind Regards,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; *Managing Director*<br>&gt;&gt; Little Scribblers Kindergarten<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; *HEAD OFFICE - Centre of Excellence*<br>&gt;&gt; 106 Russell Avenue<br>&gt;&gt; Dolls Point NSW 2219<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt; M: 0448 619 864<br>&gt;&gt; HO: 1300 300 011<br>&gt;&gt; E: Jackie@littlescribblers.com.au<br>&gt;&gt; Web:  www.littlescribblers.com.a",
