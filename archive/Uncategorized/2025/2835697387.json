i was flustered by it all with a new baby but oone thing both me.... and all my caseworkewrs had been awares of was that i was much more than 2 weeks in advanced at my previous proiperty.<br>\ni had also paid bond at previous property which was apparently not required at the new address.<br>\nmoving at short notice was expensive for me as my caseworker was aware and also because i had chosen to pay at my old rental till over the weekend 04-03-2024 the weekend to cover being able to properly and adequtely clean the previous residence.<br>\ni had discussed with my case worker and there was a discussion had with Emma at the lease sign where she stated that bond release and any reimbursements would take approx 6-8 weeks. id said that was understandable and Kate my caseworker specifically stated. celeste requests that refund return to her bank account Emma said that would be fine.<br>\nDuring this same discussion an aknowledgement of water through the driveway was had but i was assured that it was being handled through maintainence as priorty.<br>\nEmma left almost immediately.<br>\n-when filling out the condition report i noted that clear parts of it had not be properly filled in by Emma.... i was so grateful for housing and an idea of 5 year plan to better place myself and jennyplace had been so great with me i didnt query it too much.<br>\nas i thought i should be trusting the process.<br>\ni completed and returned the condition report within 4 days and had noted several things that really needed attention. so much so that even my case worker at the time sent corrospondence to Emma.<br>\nFrom seeing her that on time and there after it was an uphill battle to get any clear communication from her regarding the things requested relating to repairs.<br>\nMy baby was still only very little so it was fairlhy hard to manage things however i ensured that previous residence was left immmaculate and all rubbish ect was arranged for removal.<br>\n<br>\nI continued to be pateient relating to repairs at property (to this day a light fitting at the proprty remains unusable in a main room) and i couldnt unlock windows for months....and release of my bond and monies owing.<br>\nEmma became very short /completely absent so i liased with several different caseworkers through jennysplace whom were all aware that i was well in advance and waiting for nond and monies returned. however even they, seemed at a loss to get a response from emma.<br>\ni had pretty much given up on the idea of her being a viable avenue in relation to maintainence of the property.<br>\nbut the filtered information i had begun to recieve about my bond and monies owed was disheartening and concerning.<br>\nEmma was very dismissive when i tried to clear with her that the bourke street property was cleared for bond release..... and i subsequenlty didnt get that money till MONTHS AND MONTHS after..... i again was disapointed as it was only the bind returned.<br>\nin this time i had some how been billed a bill of APPROX $1108 but never notified until i was served WHC letter head threatening if i did not pay NCAT action would be launched.<br>\nit was subsequently aknowleged this was a 'software\" error??? however the charge remained on my account for approximately 9 months.... even though Emma repeatedly made promises to rectify this.<br>\nin emails my current caseworker had ccd me into there was a back and forth conversation where again emma was dismissive of monies owed and tried to iimply that i ws behind in rent. i was adamant that this was not correct so bec requested the ledgers be forwarded. i doubt myself but the minute i compared the ledgers to my centrewpay deductions there were massive unexplained descrepancies that were sooo unexplainably apparent.<br>\nbec ended up establishing that my account or monies owed stiill, was infact $818.08... no small sum. it took Emma yet again over another week before the due moniese were finally processed, '<br>\ni never recieved an explanation or apology or anything..... and to gaslight anyone or make anyone wait such a long time with out any kind of aknowledgement or explanantion really left me feeling jaded and confused.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nat no point have i been rude pushy or abrasive with this woman. i dont know how or why it has been acceptable for her to continue to carry the job title of tenancy manager yet at each and every point of engagement she is absent.<br>\n<br>\ni still await account explanantions and for her to actively engage with me in order to better understand these matters and the matters still at hand in regards to my tenanted property.<br>\n<br>\nwhatever happened with the monies and wrongful billings does not and did not feel anywhere near legal moral or alingned with any of your policies or procedures.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nmany thnaks<br>\n<br>\nceleste</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>",
