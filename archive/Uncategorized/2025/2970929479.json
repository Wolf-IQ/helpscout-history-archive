These keys can sometimes expire or need to be refreshed due to security updates or changes in the system.<br></li><li><strong>Plugin Version</strong> \u2014 The plugin itself was slightly behind. On June 16, we updated it to version 2.9.3 and tested it with the new keys, but unfortunately it still wasn\u2019t working. Then, just last night, the plugin developers released a newer version (2.9.4). After updating to this latest version and testing everything again with the updated keys, it all started working correctly.<br></li></ul><br>It was really just a case of some unfortunate timing - the plugin update that fully resolved the issue was only released very recently. <br>",

And for reasons I don't know, their avenues of contact are not working, they are throwing error screens at me.<br>\n    <br>\n    So I then reached out to ANZ Worldline support, who have communicated with Cybersource in the past for us. I explained we need help and provided the details you suggested we forward on. They have only just responded to me and their message was as follows:<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>If it's a woocommerce plugin for Cybersource, you and your web dev need to engage the plugin provider as it will be coding within the plugin.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>We generally do not provide support for plugins since they do not belong to ANZWL.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>There are up coming releases in which may be the plugin has been updated to, and you may just need to upgrade your version perhaps as a wild guess.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Happy to be looped in your communications with them in case there is something they would like to ask us to support you too.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    In further conversation about this with Andrew Dunham, he has forwarded me a couple of emails received from Cybersource earlier this year. I can't find record in my emails of having received these emails myself, so I'm not sure who has read or sought to action them, but I wonder if this message may be relevant. The email is as below:<br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Dear Valued Customer,</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>You are receiving this notification as you have been identified as a merchant utilizing our Flex API Direct Integration.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>This is the first of a series of notifications that will help you make the changes needed to move to the new and upgraded Flex API solution experience (Flex API v2).</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Overview</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>The Flex API enables merchants to securely accept customer payment information captured within a server-side application or on a customer's device, for example within a native iOS or Android application. The Flex API protects your customer's primary account number (PAN), card verification number (CVN), and other payment information by embedding it within a transient token, reducing risk and simplifying Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>As part of our commitment to modernizing our offerings and enhancing the security of our products, we are deprecating older versions of the Flex API. This initiative is designed to improve security for payment card transactions, safeguard sensitive information, maintain trust in electronic payment systems, and reduce the likelihood of data breaches.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>By upgrading to the latest versions of our Flex API product, merchants can take advantage of the latest security enhancements and technological advancements, ensuring more secure and efficient transaction processing.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>What action is required?</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Our records show that you use Flex API v1; Flex API v1 will reach end of life on July 1, 2025. You must upgrade to Flex API v2 on or before this date. Failure to do so will result in transaction failures.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Steps for migrating from Flex API v1 to v2 can be found in this Knowledgebase article:</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>https://support.visaacceptance.com/knowledgebase/Knowledgearticle/?code=KA-07698</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>If further clarification is required, you may also reach out to our Cybersource Customer Support team via your usual methods.</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Thank You,</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    <strong>Cybersource Customer Support</strong><br>\n    <br>\n    Does any of this help to understand what the problem might be and does it shed any light on further things you might be able to look at to fix the situation please?<br>\n    <br>\n    Do you want to be \"looped in\" with the email from ANZ Worldline, would that help?<br>\n    <br>\n    I really don't know where else to turn to fix this so anything you can do to help would be greatly appreciated.\n</p><div class=\"helpscout-signature\">\nThanks<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Erin Skinner</strong> <strong>TOTAL EYECARE SUPPORT GROUP</strong><br>\n<br>\nAdministration Manager<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Total Eyecare Support Group</strong><br>\n<br>\n18 Magnet Court, Sandy Bay TAS 7005<br>\n<br>\n<strong>P</strong>: 03 6231 5744 <strong>E</strong>: accounts@totaleyecare.com.au<br>\n<br>\ntotaleyecare.com.au<br>\n<br>\n<img border=\"0\" width=\"268\" height=\"97\" class=\"ex-c15\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/6015d9b6b6f188691e1e6b0e81c7fbfd18bbadae/100f3f99f34952897d0ebaedddddeddcd7f0db2c/image001.png\" alt=\"image001.png@01DBE081.396672E0\"><br>\n<br>\n<em>CONFIDENTIAL: This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.
