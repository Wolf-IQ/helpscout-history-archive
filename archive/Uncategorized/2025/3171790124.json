I'll check in with our tech team and get back to you to confirm whether we need the separate environment.<br>\n<br>\nOne additional high-priority item is updating the FAQ section on a page I'm working on. As raised previously, the text in list grid components is disappearing again, which means I'm unable to update it myself.<br>\n<br>\nIf it's faster, could you please update the FAQs on my behalf so I can share them internally for approval? We can then address the underlying issue separately.<br>\n<br>\nBelow is the content for the FAQ section, and here <a href=\"https://www.stellainsurance.com.au/wp-admin/post.php?post=19233&amp;action=elementor\">is the template of the page I am working on</a>:<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Why choose Stella?</strong><br>\n<br>\nStella is a purpose-driven insurance brand that is mission-led, authentically different and passionately pro-women. We are passionate about challenging the status quo, championing equality and building products for a fairer world.<br>\n<br>\nAt Stella, we prioritise the needs and lifestyles of women, adapting and tailoring product and experiences with you in mind. We want to empower customers and humanise insurance which is clearly no small challenge.<br>\n<br>\nBeyond insurance, we partner with like-minded people and organisations creating a community to drive actionable change for women. A portion of our profits is given to women focused charities and organisations with a shared vision to help improve the lives of women. The world moves forward when we work together, as partners, allies, equals.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Is Stella for women only?</strong><br>\n<br>\nNo, we are not for women only. We are a female-focused brand with a vision to balance the gender biases that exist for women. In saying that, we insure men and non-binary too and see ourselves as an inclusive community.<br>\n<br>\nWe have thousands of customers who are men and non-binary and are proud that our customers are supportive of our position to support and empower women.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>What is life, income and home loan insurance?</strong><br>\n<br>\nLife insurance, income protection and home loan protection are designed to provide financial support if something unexpected happens. Each type of cover supports you in different ways, depending on what you want to protect.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>How can I get life, income or home loan insurance?</strong><br>\n<br>\nYou can get a quote online through Stella.

We've looked into and here are the details:\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Last Update Run was Dec 18, 2025 (Logged by Joel, 3 days after she started).</li>\n<li>We operate on a monthly maintenance cycle (scheduled for the 2nd week of each month).</li>\n<li>Between Dec 19 - Jan 14, developers released new versions of those plugins.</li>\n<li>The \"pending updates\" she sees now are new versions that accumulated after our last round, not old ones we ignored.</li>\n<li>We are currently in the scheduled January maintenance window.</li>\n</ul>\nLet me know if that is what you were expecting?\n\nOur team will get started investigating the Plugin removal now to ensure not going to impact the rest of the site.\n\nThanks so much,\nAndy\n<img alt=\"Screenshot 2026-01-14 at 3.02.48\u202fPM.png\" width=\"562\" height=\"468\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/daa980ce325720e2bb07e2ed0c7540e8c3271564/f537c24b84173b6590d4965a19f18cabb3172700/Screenshot-2026-01-14-at-3-02-48-PM.png\"/>",

I just want to clarify a few points and align on next steps.<br>\n<br>\nFirst, could you please share a clear timeline for when the items below will be actioned? As mentioned earlier, nothing has been actioned since 15 December, when I started. Having clear deadlines will help manage expectations, especially as several of these items should not take a significant amount of time.<br>\n<br>\nI'll be expecting items 1 and 2 below to be actioned today.<br>\n<br>\nRegarding the technical work, I want to reiterate that any on-page SEO optimisation will be requested as specific tasks going forward. That said, ensuring headlines follow a correct hierarchical structure is part of standard on-page SEO and is included in our current plan. As this was not implemented correctly in previous work, I don't believe it should be deducted from our support hours and should be fixed by your team at no additional cost.<br>\n<br>\nI've reordered the list below by priority and added a few missing tasks that I had previously requested. Please confirm when each of these will be actioned.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Priority tasks:</strong><br>\n<br>\n<ol><br>\n<li><br>\n<strong>Plugin maintenance</strong>: Clear the backlog of pending updates (currently 11 plugins).<br>\n</li><br>\n<li><br>\n<strong>Plugin removal</strong>: Remove the plugins previously requested and migrate all redirections into RankMath.<br>\n</li><br>\n<li><br>\n<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: Resolve the \"disappearing text\" issue within Elementor containers, particularly on product listing pages.<br>\n</li><br>\n<li><br>\n<strong>Code cleanup:</strong> Identify and remove redundant Elementor containers to improve load speed.<br>\n</li><br>\n<li><br>\n<strong>Gutenberg transition:</strong> Deactivate the legacy Gutenberg plugin in a staging environment and replace any broken containers with modern Elementor equivalents.<br>\n</li><br>\n</ol><br>\n<br>\n<ol><br>\n<li><br>\n<strong>Header-tag audit</strong>: Correct the header hierarchy across all pages for SEO compliance. As noted above, <strong>this should not be deducted from our allocated time</strong>. Please ensure there is only one H1 per page. If there is a tagline under the H1, it should be formatted as a paragraph, not a heading. Any subsequent section headings should be H2, with headings under those sections set as H3 where applicable. Please let me know if you have any questions about this.<br>\n</li><br>\n</ol><br>\n<br>\nLooking forward to your confirmation on timelines so we can move forward.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Andrea Bermudez</strong><br>\n<div class=\"helpscout-signature\">Head of Marketing<br>\n<br>\nm 0415 881 835<br>\n<br>\ne andrea.bermudez@stellainsurance.com.au<br>\n<br>\nw <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/stellainsurance.com.au/__;!!JN-wFnoC!IY3mGi1ldLRcyH9V0gYsBZjhkt0Z4Vm0JT69oG7-PDoiqFpTEKSUEfg88nSrU9rU4f5D-pQS6m6t_fGC6HBU1PpSghsuHbrKmp83%24\">stellainsurance.com.au</a><br>\n<br>\n<img alt=\"signatureImage\" width=\"234\" height=\"88\" class=\"ex-c10\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/f427dc685a92df83319e0b24f594b8f68d519c32/ee0e6b96ce8c10f26cc31257e6a1d193487d7396/image001.jpg\"/></div>",

For the header tags: there are ~50 unique pages and ~200 posts using a similar template.\n\nReviewing the unique ones and the template will take ~2 hours assuming 2-3 minutes per page. Let us know if you'd like us to proceed with this (or if the other technical items are higher priority).\n\nThank you,\nAndy\n\n***\n\n<strong>Priorities</strong>\n<strong>1.

Time spent on every ticket is tracked<br></li><li>Attached is a CSV of the support requests for the last 12 months.<br><br></li></ul><b>Maintenance and Updates</b><br><ul><li>We perform updates in controlled batches to ensure plugin compatibility and site stability, rather than auto-updating immediately which carries security and breakage risks. <br></li><li>As we co-pilot websites with customers, we don't delete plugins unless requested or present security risk<br></li><li>We are happy to audit and remove inactive plugins during this week's maintenance round to adhere to best practices.<br></li></ul><br><b>Redirects</b><br><ul><li>No problems, we will proceed with migrating redirects to RankMath.<br></li><li>This typically requires 15\u201330 minutes depending on the volume of rules. <br></li></ul><br><b>SEO Ownership</b><br><ul><li>Noted - we will stand by for your direction.<br></li></ul><br><b>Hosting and CDN Pricing</b><br><ul><li>Our Care Plans are a bundled service rather than a line-item breakdown. <br></li><li>The $259/month covers high-performance Google Cloud hosting, Enterprise CDN, daily backups, security scanning, and the 2 hours of engineering time.<br></li><li>The raw underlying hosting and CDN costs are probably ~$50 , with the remainder for everything else<br></li></ul><br><b>Plugins (Technical Rationale)</b><br><ul><li><b>Classic Editor:</b> We keep this for compatibility with legacy page sections that do not render correctly in Gutenberg. We will test removing it; if the layout holds, we will delete it.<br></li><li><b>Enable Media Replace:</b> We recommend keeping this. Deleting and re-uploading a file changes the image ID in the database, which often breaks links across the site. This plugin allows us to update assets safely without breaking front-end visuals.<br></li><li><b>PublishPress Revisions:</b> This is used to stage content updates and manage editorial approvals without publishing live immediately. It is critical for maintaining compliance on regulated sites before changes go public.<br></li><li><b>Yoast Duplicate Post:</b> We will remove this as requested and utilize Elementor templates for duplication moving forward.<br></li></ul><br><b>Analytics</b><br><ul><li>There is an existing Google tag on the site that wasn\u2019t set up by our team, and we don\u2019t currently have access to it. To avoid disrupting existing data, we haven\u2019t modified it.<br></li><li>If you can confirm whether you still have access, or would like us to create and manage a new GA4 setup, we\u2019re happy to proceed and send you an invite once complete.<br></li></ul>",
