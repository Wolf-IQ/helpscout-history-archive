It appears the plugin configuration reacted aggressively in the live environment (or the method has since been patched/conflicted), leading to:<br><ul><li><b>Aggressive Caching:</b> The plugin likely served a cached version that clashed with the new layout, making things look broken on mobile even though the underlying code was correct.<br></li><li><b>Minification Conflicts:</b> The plugin \"squished\" the CSS/JS files too tightly, which prevented the browser from reading instructions for the Carousel and Forms.<br></li><li><b>Script Deferral:</b> To speed up load times, the plugin forced interactive elements to load last, causing buttons and links to become unclickable.<br><br></li></ul><b>Next Steps &amp; Timeline:</b> Because the plugin method and imagify for optimising the website is proving unstable, we are abandoning that path.<br><ul><li>We will investigate deeper and switch to <b>manual code tweaks</b> to optimize the site safely.<br></li><li><b>Timeline:</b> Since this involves careful manual adjustments rather than an automated plugin, this will take <b>more than a day</b> to resolve properly to ensure we don't break the layout again.<br><br></li></ul>We will keep you posted.<br>",
