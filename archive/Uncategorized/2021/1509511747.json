            "body": "Your typeform Intake Questionnaire has a new response:<br><ul><li><b>First up, let us know your name please : )</b><br>\nBrendon<br></li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none;\"><br></li>\n<li><b>Awesome, hi Brendon! Now, can you please tell me about your business, what do you do?</b><br>\nPhysio clinic in Balmain, \"connect therapy\" is a Canadian approach, holistic and interprets information about your driver for your problem and looks at all the areas in your body to determine how best to fix. We get to the TRUE source of your problem. We look at you from head to toe. We look at the connections between areas of pain. We use manual techniques and exercises to treat conditions. Strong education piece around why you have the problem, not only the what. We look at the relationships between the conditions. We give patients the skills to self manage with exercises. They have release and reset exercises. We also run small group exercises, to reduce the need for one-on-one treatment.<br></li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none;\"><br></li>\n<li><b>Who is the main audience we're talking to?</b><br>\nFemale, 45-65, retired or older children. Generally they are affluent. They are active or like being active, but work sometimes takes over. Majority local within Balmain. 50%ish. Their partners or kids. Local gyms refer people that tend to be a bit younger with a similar demographic. Geography means we get a lot of younger kids being referred. Pregnancy is fine.<br></li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none;\"><br></li>\n<li><b>Who are your main competitors?</b><br>\nBalmain sports medicine (12 physio's, one stop shop, more athletics), i move (focus on runners and cross fitters, younger people), Connect Therapy, Liechardt and city.<br></li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none;\"><br></li>\n<li><b>And what makes you stand out from your competitors?</b><br>\nConnect Therapy, it's not a quick fix, it's a long term journey. We ask our patients what they think is going on. We get to the crux of the problem. We are more about the long term affects. We look at the why not the what - it's a different kind of physio, getting a 'wow'. Generally more subtle techniques. We give you the skills you need to self treat. Education piece is strong.<br></li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none;\"><br></li>\n<li><b>What might you say could stop people from using you?</b><br>\nWe're not the cheapest ($175/hr, $135/45min), Jane is more again ($220/$160). We have a bit of a waitlist, roughly 2-4 weeks. Generally full, but cancellations are big at the moment given fear of COVID. 35-40 patients a week. We can build out more classes, there is currently space, currently 18 classes. \"The Studio\" in Rozelle is a competitor more so on the classes.<br></li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none;\"><br></li>\n<li><b>And what is your proposition to help overcome this?</b><br>\nThey may not come, not get results and then come back. Re availability we keep a waitlist which tends to work well.<br></li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none;\"><br></li>\n<li><b>Have you seen any designs or brands that you particularly like?</b><br>\nI don't like busy. They are clean and simple. Use the colours sparingly. Apple is clean and simple and not too busy.<br></li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none;\"><br></li>\n<li><b>Anything else I need to know?</b><br>\nThings need to be intuitive, not too busy, simple.<br></li>\n<li style=\"list-style:none;\"><br></li>\n</ul><br>\nLog in to view or download your responses at<br>\nhttps://admin.typeform.com/form/cW8vaVTQ/results<br><br>\nYou can turn off or configure self notifications for this typeform at<br>\nhttps://admin.typeform.com/form/cW8vaVTQ/create/hash/notifications<br><br>\nTeam Typeform<br>\nHow you ask is everything<br><br>\nWant your responses automatically sent to a Google Sheet, MailChimp, Trello, or your own CRM? <strong>Set up an integration to do that and much more:</strong><br>\nhttps://admin.typeform.com/form/cW8vaVTQ/connect<br><br><span style=\"color:#FFF;\">6pvglgiict5dehtwv96pv4zv54fuycw8</span>\n<p style=\"color:#AAA;font-family:sans-serif;font-size:10pt;\">Typeform sent you this email on behalf of a typeform creator.
