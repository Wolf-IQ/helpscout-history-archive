Then it's over to an SEO specialist/agency to do the keyword/campaign management to optimise of keywords and to knock the competition down a few pegs. Similar to what DigitalMaas was doing for you guys in the past. <br /><br />If you want a referral for a specialist agency we can recommend one, but it does get pricey as I'm sure you are aware. Our recommended company does get results, but they start at around $1,250/month. Let me know this is feasible and if so, I can make an introduction for you.\u00a0<br /><br />Happy to talk through this in more detail if you prefer too.\u00a0",
