I was explaining to him that they are just instructions with zero risk of me gaining access to any sensitive material haha.\u00a0<br /><br />Ok so you can reply to that email with the responses to the below, but, the PayPal account will work without it. The only features that won't work are:<br /><br /><ul><li>Allowing a customer to have multiple subscriptions</li><li>The ability to change the recurring monthly amount once they have signed up</li><li>Changing of the payment due dates, e.g. changing from the 30th of every month to the 22nd of each month</li><li>The ability for a customer to change their method of payment once they sign up</li><li>The ability for an admin to change the method of payment once a customer has signed up\u00a0</li></ul>These are all deemed 'advanced' features and you probably would be fine. <br /><br />If your customers are not too fussed on PayPal, I would also consider just using Stripe for the convenience\u00a0of having to manage only one income stream (from the website). And the fact that PayPal can be a nightmare. It will get interesting if you have to issue refunds or need help with auditing transactions etc. <br /><br />Let me know how you go?\u00a0",

Mainly the reason we want to turn PayPal on is that we have a lot more EU members coming through and every year we get people saying they don't have a Visa debit card or similar (apparently it's not a thing in some EU countries, just regular debit cards) and so they can't process via Stripe, and request PayPal. It's awesome we've got it now for the standard checkout, but a huge portion of Rebels' members come through on the payment plan so it would be good to give them that option.<br><br>Is this a pain in your experience? Or would we be safe to turn PayPal on for the subscription product?<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>Casey <br>Rebels SUPPORT<br><br>e. rebels@tarabliss.com.au<br>w. tarabliss.com.au/rebels-of-light",
