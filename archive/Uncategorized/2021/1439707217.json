This is 12 monthly payments of $550 inc GST.\u00a0You have currently made 11 payments and your final payment is on 31 March 2021.\u00a0<br /><br />At that point, you have paid off your website, so we will downgrade you to a website hosting and care plan only.<br /><br />There are 2 options:<br /><br /><ul><li><strong>Lite Plan,</strong> same great hosting and core updates, with no included support time per month. This is $125/month.</li><li><strong>Pro Plan,</strong> same great hosting, more frequent updates and 2 hours of support time included per month. This is $250/month.\u00a0</li></ul>Based on your current requirements, you should be fine to go opt for the Lite Plan and just pay for support 'on demand' at $99/hr. Alternatively, if you go to the Pro Plan you have peace of mind that you won't incur any additional fees and\u00a0we can bundle in our Accessibility tool (valued at $1,000/year). It has been developed to help patients with an array of disabilities from vision impairment, motor issues and even cognitive conditions. You can see it running on our site <a href=\"https://wolfiq.com.au\">https://wolfiq.com.au</a>, just click the little blue icon in the bottom right corner of the browser.\u00a0<br /><br />Let me know which Plan you would like to go with? Hope you are well and speak soon,<br />",
