I copied the boxes and couldn\u2019t remove it<br><br>2/ Under the Contact phone field it says \u201cSame as Styling address?\u201d<br>Can we amend it to \u201cYour Address - same as styling address?  Yes/no buttons as you have it to produce an address box.<br>Can we delete the address ID box<br>3/ If I click accept on the Pay Later or Pay on Success pop up, it takes you back to the payment card. Could we have it so that it takes you to the \u201cEnter Personal and Contract details\u201d so the customer doesn\u2019t have to scroll down<br>4/ If someone selects a payment card (eg pay upfront) the screen stays still and the payment card is highlighted in gold. Because it doesn\u2019t scroll down for the customer, they may be tempted to hit the payment card again, thinking nothing has happened. If they do, it then reverts back 2 steps and displays the accept proposal button again. It has the potential to frustrate customers who are feeling they are in a loop.<br>In addition, are we able to delete the random accept proposal button that appears below the payment cards when you select a payment card option (the second time)<br>Call me if I haven\u2019t explained that well<br>5/ At the very bottom, after they have signed the contract there is a green button that says \u201cSubmit\u201d. Can we change that to \u201caccept proposal\u201d<br>6/ I have made minor tweaks to the Pay Later pop up (attached) if you could amend<br>7/ In the Pay On Success pop up, can we capitalise the words Commitment Period (It\u2019s a definition word for the provider). Can we make the red and green buttons visible in the pop up without the customer having to scroll down<br>8/ For anyone who selects Pay Later or Pay on Success, where there is a bond in the quote, we would want them to be processed exactly as they are now with a bond on Pay Later with our current Pay Later provider - Elevare.<br>The bond would not appear on Pay upfront<br>The process would be<br>They would choose either Pay Later, or Pay on Success and then the box below should appear please change the word Elevare to CampaignFlow)<br><br>then the credit card fields should appear for completion<br>complete the personal and contract details<br>Sign the contract<br>Tick the t\u2019s and c\u2019s<br>Accept proposal and be redirected to Campaign Flow<br><br>9/ Can you search the words Pay On Success for anywhere in the pop ups or on the platform and ensure anywhere it appears that it has a capital P, O and S at the start of each word<br>10/ Can you search the word Campaign Flow for anywhere in the pop ups or on the platform.
