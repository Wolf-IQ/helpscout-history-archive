Our recommendations remain unchanged, and they are to move your payment gateway away from the current Commbank setup as it is a limited solution.\u00a0<br /><br />We have previously recommended Stripe as the leading option for your business case. Please be sure to get in touch if you'd like to chat about this further. We can of course provide you with the next steps and assist in getting it up and running on your website.\u00a0",
