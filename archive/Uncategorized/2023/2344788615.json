Note that I did check with other online tracking tools as well which verified that it did indeed have malware before I reached out to you.<br><br>***There are paid tiers with Sucuri, but it's likely above and beyond what is required and can slow the site down due to extra security checks. We have further tightened the security on appledental.com.au by increasing the firewall protection and what it allows/blocks. I will also note, that in all the years that this site has been hosted by us, that it's the first incident of this kind. So we should not see a repeat.<br><br>Apologies, I didn\u2019t meant the site was down \u2013 as in the malware was up and our Google Ads were down since the Friday, which means that the malware could\u2019ve been on the site for longer than the Friday as that was only when Google Ads noticed it.<br><br>***This is possible, but unknown. Malcare did not pick it up prior, so it's unlikely. Sucuri must have found the same malware on other WordPress sites so was able to locate it sooner. These security networks rely on the detection of threats, then look for patterns and across many websites with similar configurations to determine if they have been breached. This is why we see some platforms pick up issues before others.<br><br>How did your systems not show that there was malware until I notified you? I just wanted to check when the daily schedule runs were for Malcare across all of our sites because it seemed to missed it from at least Friday to the Monday morning I notified you. We essentially just want to ensure that we are getting notifications as soon as this happens rather than having 3 full days of missed Ads and potential threat the website for longer.<br><br>***The MalCare checks are run daily during off-peak hours. It did fail to detect the malware in this instance. Which, again, is very odd. We use this exact setup on 100's of websites. If Malcare does detect malware, our team is alerted. We also have 3rd party dedication provided from our hostign company. Both didn't detect the malware, likely because it was not a true threat. We still have the free version of Sucuri installed on appledental.com.au. Any issues will be emailed to webmaster@nationaldentalcare.com.au. We can add additional emails if you like?<br><br><br><br>Thanks and speak soon,<br><br><br>![heath-maguire.png](https://wolfiq.com.au/email-sig/heath-maguire.png)<br><br>### Heath Maguire<br>Creative Director<br>Wolf IQ Pty Ltd<br><br>![phone-icon-2x.png](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/tools/email-signature-generator/icons/phone-icon-2x.png) 1300 072 134 | 0415 162 271<br><br>![email-icon-2x.png](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/tools/email-signature-generator/icons/email-icon-2x.png) heath@wolfiq.com.au<br><br>![link-icon-2x.png](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/tools/email-signature-generator/icons/link-icon-2x.png) wolfiq.com.au<br><br>![address-icon-2x.png](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/tools/email-signature-generator/icons/address-icon-2x.png) Level 2, 383 George Street, Sydney NSW 2000<br><br>![wolf-logo.png](https://wolfiq.com.au/email-sig/wolf-logo.png)<br><br>![linkedin](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/53/tools/email-signature-generator/icons/linkedin-icon-2x.png)<br>We'd love to hear from you.

Sucuri keeps a public record of such events, I might add that they can report false positives, so it's good to check with other online security tracking tools to verify.<br><br>I can confirm that Malcare is running on all of our sites. I have attached a screenshot of the security at work as well as a summary report from 23 Aug to 6 Sep. Also, the site was not down, it was simply showing as having malware by Sucuri's scanners.

Note that I did check with other online tracking tools as well which verified that it did indeed have malware before I reached out to you.<br><br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Apologies, I didn\u2019t meant the site was down \u2013 as in the malware was up and our Google Ads were down since the Friday, which means that the malware could\u2019ve been on the site for longer than the Friday as that was only when Google Ads noticed it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; How did your systems not show that there was malware until I notified you? I just wanted to check when the daily schedule runs were for Malcare across all of our sites because it seemed to missed it from at least Friday to the Monday morning I notified you. We essentially just want to ensure that we are getting notifications as soon as this happens rather than having 3 full days of missed Ads and potential threat the website for longer.<br><br><br>Thanks, and keen to hear back from you.<br><br>Regards,<br>Alyssa<br><br>Combinate<br>support@combinate.me<br>www.combinate.me<br>1300 247 018<br><br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>Heath Maguire - Wolf IQ, 6 Sept 2023, 13:38 GMT+10<br><br>Hi Alyssa,<br><br>We installed the Sucuri plugin so that we could validate that the malware had been removed from Sucuri's records. Sucuri keeps a public record of such events, I might add that they can report false positives, so it's good to check with other online security tracking tools to verify.<br><br>I can confirm that Malcare is running on all of our sites. I have attached a screenshot of the security at work as well as a summary report from 23 Aug to 6 Sep. Also, the site was not down, it was simply showing as having malware by Sucuri's scanners.

Sucuri keeps a public record of such events, I might add that they can report false positives, so it's good to check with other online security tracking tools to verify.<br><br>I can confirm that Malcare is running on all of our sites. I have attached a screenshot of the security at work as well as a summary report from 23 Aug to 6 Sep. Also, the site was not down, it was simply showing as having malware by Sucuri's scanners.

Does Malcare protect all of our websites? I\u2019m asking as it looks like your team installed Sucuri on Apple Dental, so I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s for protection on the site which we\u2019d like across all of our websites.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Just with the daily scan, what time is it usually scheduled to go out? For Apple Dental it looks like the website was down from at least Friday until the Monday morning when I sent the email over.

She will receive an email with instructions to create her password.<br><br>Regarding the Malware, it's hard to know, but typically, it will come through on either a core WordPress or plugin vulnerability. It's the nature of the beast with WordPress really. The precaution is to stay on top of the available updates (which we do as part of their plan) and to monitor the code (we do daily checks).

She will receive an email with instructions to create her password.<br><br>Regarding the Malware, it's hard to know, but typically, it will come through on either a core WordPress or plugin vulnerability. It's the nature of the beast with WordPress really. The precaution is to stay on top of the available updates (which we do as part of their plan) and to monitor the code (we do daily checks).
