I have attached 2 screenshots to allow you to compare.\u00a0Files that are too big can and will affect website load speeds so it is important that the image is optimised prior to upload.\u00a0<br /><br />If you have the tools needed to optimise the images in house, you are welcome to copy our recommended size/quality. Alternatively, we are happy to optimise these for you. These can be done one at a time, or in batches. We just need the file or stock image link.<br /><br />Please let me know your preferred approach and we'll adjust accordingly.\u00a0",
