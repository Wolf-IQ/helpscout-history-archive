A third of those women will experience perimenopausal anxiety and depression. It also has the highest rate for suicide &lt;https://honey.nine.com.au/latest/perimenopause-menopause-women-mental-health/8f8fbadc-f2cc-419e-8604-70894e3e5719&gt; in a woman\u2019s life.<br><br>My life took a change for the worse when perimenopausal depression &lt;https://honey.nine.com.au/latest/breakthrough-perimenopausal-depression-shelly-horton/439eec5a-2981-472e-aa5c-85043d464ecb&gt; poleaxed me.<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s one thing struggling with a bit of night sweats or some joint pains, but actually when it\u2019s your mental health, this is a real crisis,\u201d says Dr Newson.<br><br>\u201cUK women are no different to Australian women or women in any other country, they might just express it in different ways,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not saying every woman has these extremes but one in three women get depression or anxiety during the menopause.\u201d<br><br>Research undertaken by Professor Jayashri Kulkarni, Director of the HER Centre Australia &lt;https://www.monash.edu/medicine/her-centre&gt; and Monash Psychiatry research centre shows anti-depressants are not the best way to treat peri and menopausal depression and anxiety.<br><br>Prof Kulkarni's research shows peri and menopausal depression should be treated differently than regular depression because it's a hormonal imbalance. Therefore, it should be treated with hormones.  It\u2019s about creating a direct impact to your hormones and your brain chemistry.<br><br>Despite mental health education campaigns and awareness-raising, women are still made to feel it\u2019s taboo to talk about mental health challenges &lt;https://honey.nine.com.au/latest/depression-during-perimenopause/5c919957-e9e4-40aa-9730-af47a5e7da43&gt; during midlife.<br><br>\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of misogyny,\u201d says Dr Newson.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of medical gaslighting, there\u2019s a lot of patriarchal medicine that\u2019s going on.\u201d<br><br>Both Prof Kulkarni and Dr Newson agree, gynaecologists aren\u2019t looking at women\u2019s mental health enough and psychiatrists aren\u2019t prescribing hormones enough, and that needs to change.<br><br>And boy is Dr Newson getting blow back.  It\u2019s turned into a witch hunt in her home country.  She has come under fire for prescribing over the set limits for HRT.<br><br>She responded just as strongly, explaining in an article in The Independent &lt;https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/menopause-hrt-drugs-social-media-b2396609.html&gt; that she follows evidence-based protocols but, \u201cretains the clinical freedom to tailor patients\u2019 treatments according to clinical need. Within an informed consent framework, I provide patients with a treatment plan that suits their individual requirements.\u201d<br><br>Sadly, most of the obstacles Newson is facing is from within the medical fraternity, \u201cWhen I pushed back and said, \u2018What is your concern?\u2019 One of them said to me recently, \u2018Well, you are not a gynaecologist.\u2019\u201d<br><br>Newson\u2019s reaction was a masterclass in mic-drop moments, \u201cI\u2019ve got a pathology degree that\u2019s a first-classhonours degree. I\u2019ve got an honours degree in my medicine degree. I\u2019m a member of the Royal College of the Physicians, and I\u2019m a fellow of the Royal College of GPs.  What qualifications do I have that mean that I can\u2019t read the same papers as you and then treat people?\u2019 They really didn\u2019t like that at all.\u201d<br><br>In my opinion, it\u2019s not that different in Australia, through my role as part of the first ever parliamentary round table on menopause, I discovered the peak menopause bodies, and their research royalty are high on ego and low on empathy for real women. It was far from inclusive, in fact often combative.<br><br>Leaving every day women struggling to get evidence-based help while the experts fight each other to protect their patch.<br><br>It should always come down to choice.  Some women thrive on HRT, others find solace in lifestyle changes. It's your life, your body, your choice.<br><br>Dr Newson agrees, \u201cI feel we should be allowed a choice, and we should know that as women we should be able to change our mind as well.  We need to be treated as an individual and listened to by health care professionals.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMy wish is that everybody has the right education and support. I wish that there was access that was, if it's not free, but really cheap so no one is finding it difficult to access hormones.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI wish there was just less stigma about it and less of this bullying and behind-the-scenes witch hunt that's going on because it's really not helpful.  We need to realise we haven\u2019t got all the evidence, but actually we\u2019ve got a lot of common sense, basic science, physiology, pharmacology knowledge that is valid.\u201d<br><br>The curtain is slowly rising on the reality of menopause and mental health, thanks to champions like Dr Newson. The fight isn't over, but with advocates like her, the future for peri and menopausal women is looking a bit less sweaty and a lot more sane.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Shelly Horton<br><br>0404 868 463<br><br>https://shellshockedmedia.com &lt;https://shellshockedmedia.com/&gt;",
