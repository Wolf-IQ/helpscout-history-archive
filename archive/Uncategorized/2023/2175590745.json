Please keep in mind the updates are released sporadically, i.e. not on the same day of each month and include the core WordPress updates, 12 of your plugins and 2 theme files. So there may be occasions where an update is released after we have performed the monthly maintenance. In most cases, this is not an issue, but lately, you have experienced these 2 isolated incidences. <br /><br />The most recent incident was due to the original developers and how they built the page in a non-best-practice way. That information was actually listed twice and just 'hidden'. With the most recent update, it must have flushed out their bandaid fix and revealed the hidden copy. This is something that we would struggle to recognise as we don't do a full website read after each update. We look for broken pages etc., but duplicate content as you experienced is definitely very rare. I believe the same happened when the original developers left in the random team members etc.\u00a0<br /><br />For peace of mind, I encourage you to have a click through the website to see if any undesired elements have appeared. We can definitely remove these for you, however, we are not across the intricate details to know what should be visible and what should not. I hope this makes sense and thanks for your understanding.",
