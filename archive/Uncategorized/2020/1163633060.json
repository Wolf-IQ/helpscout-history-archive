I\u2019ve started this email 5 times and then been distracted.<br><br>Please see below re the new site:<br><br>Short Term Hire<br>Add an \u201ci\u201d button next to \u201cTotal Weeks\u201d and \u201cTotal Rental Price\u201d which, when you hover over, says \u201cThe longer you hire for the lower the weekly rate. If your hire period is less than 4 weeks, there is a short term hire fee. If your hire period is over 4 weeks you will receive 2 weeks free\u201d<br>We also need to includes a \u201cShort Term Hire Fee\u201d for any rental that is 1, 2 or 3 weeks. Please add the same \u201ci\u201d button next to that as noted above.<br><br>Calendar<br>We need to fit in a lot of info here so I\u2019m just trying to think how we can do it without it getting too confusing! I\u2019m wondering if we should stick to the Dashboard terms for the calendar and only add notes (with a red / orange banner) when it\u2019s something that needs to be actioned from our end\u2026no note means no action needed! I can then scan the calendar quickly to see if action is needed.<br>Draft<br>Selection<br>Delivery Date TBC \u2013 red banner<br>Closed for selection (for jobs past the selection phase but not yet submitted) \u2013 red banner<br>Confirmed<br>Not Paid \u2013 red banner<br>Past Delivery Date \u2013 orange banner<br>Delivered<br>Not Paid \u2013 red banner<br>Pick Up Date TBC \u2013 red banner<br>Processing<br>Not Paid \u2013 red banner<br>Past Pick Up Date \u2013 orange banner<br>Collected<br>Is it possible to make it that if you click on the date (i.e. the 1 in the 1st of April) it opens the day, meaning we don\u2019t need a \u201cView Day\u201d button.<br>As there are sometimes too many jobs on a day to view at a glance, and they don\u2019t all fit in the box, if something needs to be actions (i.e. it has a red or orange banner) can we highlight the date somehow.<br><br>Selection Fee for accessories<br>As previously discussed, I would like to add \u201cHuntley + Co to select decor\u201d option to all quotes. Clients must click, \u201cYes or \u201cNo\u201d. The pricing will be based on the number of items listed.<br>$0 Up to 10 items<br>11-20 $50<br>21-30 $100<br>31-40 $150<br>41-50 $200<br>51-60 $250<br>61 or more $300<br>We will need to put this wording somewhere \u201cDon\u2019t have time to come into the showroom to select your d\u00e9cor? Don\u2019t worry, we have you covered! If you would like us to help you with selecting your d\u00e9cor you will need to contact the office 3-5 business days prior to delivery and we will discuss the brief with you over the phone. Furniture selections must be complete prior to the d\u00e9cor selection process commencing. If you have photos that you can send through it will help us to get the look just right! We will then send you photos of the key pieces such as art, rugs and lamps. Once approved we can fine tune the smaller items such as the accessories and cushions. Please note that Huntley + Co take no responsibility for change of mind on accessories that we have selected on your behalf and if items need to be swapped there will be a swap fee.<br>Payment<br>As mentioned previously, I would like to make sure all clients add a credit card when booking a job but give them the flexibility that they can still pay the initial payment via EFT but ongoing must be done by card (I am spending way too much time chasing ongoing!). One the \u201cStep 2/2\u201d Payment page, can we please say:<br>Pay for order<br>Existing Card<br>Credit Card<br>EFT<br>Pay for additional weeks<br>Existing Card<br>Credit Card<br>I would also like to add the following somewhere \u201cPlease note that you will be notified, via email, 1 week prior to the end of the initial contract to confirm if you would like to extend. If you would like to arrange collection, please notify us at least 2 business days prior to the end of the contract. If we have not heard from you, 2 business days prior to the end of the initial contract, the contract will continue on a week to week basis, and your credit card will be charged accordingly, until the collection is logged.<br>Other<br>Phil has also asked if there is an option to refresh or go back on scanners as the Scanners often freeze and you can\u2019t go back or refresh at the moment. Feel free to call him if that doesn\u2019t make sense.<br>Please make the button to choose if a TV is wall mounted or not a compulsory field, the same as Risk Protection. Please remove \u201cboth\u201d as an option.<br>Please stop the \u201cClient Name\u201d from being a compulsory field.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thank you!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Kind Regards<br>&gt; Amy Smith<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; AMY SMITH<br>&gt; CEO + CREATIVE DIRECTOR - HUNTLEY + CO &lt;https://huntleyandco.com.au/&gt;<br>&gt; E.
