Regarding the attribution of media downloads, no, unfortunately this is not a core feature of WordPress.<br><br>The team do diligently work through the requests that are sent and the tracking was setup by me. The tracking is not actually a service we offer (as part of our normal operations), nor are GTM and GA tracking a normal skill of a developer. These services are generally performed by SEO or conversation rate optimisation agencies. I personally do this for MSRA given our long history with you guys.<br><br>The best thing I can do to learn from this is to have as much lead up time as possible so we can triple check that the GA is recording the links. Even if this results in the campaign being delayed by 24hrs, we would have to weigh up what the better outcome would be, a delay of 24 hrs or the potential of broken tracking. I hope that makes sense?<br><br>Keep in mind the tracking works by recording the button click, so moving forward, we can add a button, with a temporary PDF to at least see if the tag is firing and data is being saved.<br><br>If HotJar is no longer being used, I will also remove this as it can slow down load times.

This was why we gave a heads up that it was coming and would need actioning quickly once we sent it over to give time to test that the results were showing up in GA. Unfortunately the tracking we requested was only partially actioned late on Friday, which resulted in the last minute completion of the request on Monday and subsequent error in tracking. In future, if your team are ever unsure of what is being requested please do not hesitate to get them to give myself or one of my team a call to clarify anything as we'd much rather that, than errors and omissions being made.<br><br>I've spoken with our campaign agency and they have asked whether our website CMS gives us a report on how many downloads we've had of a media file in general? Assuming that if there is a total media downloads section somewhere that we could attribute most downloads on the 23rd June to this report\u2026<br><br>I'm not familiar with HotJar but perhaps Trish would have an idea about this? I would assume not though if it's not something that has ever been discussed within our team in the last 2 years.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Lizzy",
