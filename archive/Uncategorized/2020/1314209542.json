In regards to what we discussed, could you please provide a quote for the following:\n\n<ul><li>Cloning the site so to have 2 working Axiom sites - one with .com and the other .com.au</li>\n<li>Appropriate site to load depending on IP location of the viewer</li>\n<li>Sweep of the site to determine what is irrelevant to a US audience to remove</li>\n<li>Ongoing subscription/maintenance fee for a second website i.e. would this also be $99/month</li>\n</ul>\n\nAlso, what would be the cost to have the additional features:\n\n<ul><li>Drop down option on the site to switch between Australia and U.S.</li>\n<li>Wordpress account which manages multiple sites (i.e. 2)</li>\n</ul>\n\nI understand I will require Brand Chemistry's input to QA or optimise several of our blog posts for a U.S. audience, changing the language; however based on your experience I'd like to know if there are specific pages aside from the obvious that would need to be removed which is why I've requested this in the quote request above.\n\nAlister initially wanted to simply have the website amended/updated for a global audience, which would require removing the Team page (as all Australian) and amending the Case study and Location pages, but I see it is much more involved and that removing some of these portions could have a detrimental affect on our Australian audience. The duplicate site seems the most appropriate for what we are trying to do.\n\nFinal question, in regards to email addresses, the U.S. staff would have a .com email address and at the moment the Australian staff has .com.au email addresses. In the event we move forward with the 2 sites, could the Australian staff keep the .com.au email addresses but also have the .com email addresses that would automatically reroute to .com.au? I am thinking Alister and many of the leadership team will want to have .com email addresses so they can also communicate with U.S. clientele.\n\nKindest Regards,\n\nSarah-Jane Lamont\n\nClient Relations Executive Assistant\n\n<strong>T</strong> 1300 11 22 32\n\n<strong>M</strong> 0421 478 501\n\n<strong>E</strong> sarah-jane.lamont@axiomworkplaces.com.au\n\n<strong>LI</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-jane-lamont-93542627/\">linkedin.com/in/sarah-jane-lamont-93542627/</a>\n\n<strong>W</strong> http://axiomworkplaces.com.au/\n\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/axiom-workplaces\"><img border=\"0\" width=\"30\" height=\"30\" style=\"width:0.3125in;height:0.3125in;\" alt=\"social-_0007_Vector-Smart-Object\" name=\"ex-Picture_x0020_6\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/137585774651cbb26d1ab83d361be39d2a9d5fbe/dd6bf8c51b8476941db76dc5de2f4720d835825e/image001.png\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/axiom_workplaces/\"><img border=\"0\" width=\"30\" height=\"30\" style=\"width:0.3125in;height:0.3125in;\" alt=\"social-_0006_Vector-Smart-Object\" name=\"ex-Picture_x0020_2\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/adcfaa6a407a70620b67070756f96aff3920528c/ea4417351269cbe4e1ba5dabe135e55b66824532/image002.png\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AxiomWorkplaces/\"><img border=\"0\" width=\"30\" height=\"30\" style=\"width:0.3125in;height:0.3125in;\" alt=\"social-_0005_Vector-Smart-Object\" name=\"ex-Picture_x0020_3\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/3dbdcd116e9d97c848bb6259c5e0631fbe6581b0/3bb5ea8e79292980a5d2d99c5e589900d39d9d81/image003.png\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/axiomworkplaces\"><img border=\"0\" width=\"30\" height=\"30\" style=\"width:0.3125in;height:0.3125in;\" alt=\"social-_0004_Vector-Smart-Object\" name=\"ex-Picture_x0020_4\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/33db9e837e4f2eed3d0b514e4e708728293d4865/b22b15965b844c33d29138a8e640c62f759c16f7/image004.png\"/></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://axiomworkplaces.com.au/our-insight/what-does-the-future-of-work-look-like-for-employees-employers-and-workplaces/\"><img border=\"0\" width=\"623\" height=\"162\" style=\"width:6.4895in;height:1.6875in;\" name=\"ex-Picture_x0020_5\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/747b419b4a1371098454a8ad582a641a3c227361/12d6533d88bd517a930b823d60d86391b09114ad/image005.jpg\" alt=\"image005.jpg@01D6A6DA.F5D61E20\"/></a>\n\nThis e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
