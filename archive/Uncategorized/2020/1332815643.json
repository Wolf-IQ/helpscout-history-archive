Reason I ask is I will need to start tracking the time required to make these changes as we are well over our original estimate. I trust that works for you?<br><br>Let me know and then we can proceed with the below.

I appreciate there are lots of different elements, and I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019ve now got to with the Miro board feedback, but a number of things flagged a while ago are outstanding so if there\u2019s any way I can help on this I would gladly jump in to help ensure we\u2019re being consistent.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; If the back end has been set up to update font sizes, colours, images etc then I can hop in (if allowed) and do some of these points to help. And with this in mind, here is my feedback on the latest staging site. \ud83d\ude0a<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Can you confirm the different options we\u2019ll have in terms of font style, size and colours? As would be great to have a consistency and a clear hierarchy of sizes throughout.<br>&gt; Can I update things in the staging site? Or at what point can I dive in before it goes live.. as there are quite a few things that I could help with, in terms of making it consistent.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Homepage:<br>&gt; IMAGE \u2013 can we test the attached image by Nicolas-j for the home page image?  With a blue overlay as per brand- although would still be good to know what percentage you\u2019re using\u2026 40%? I didn\u2019t hear back on that. (image sent via wetransfer)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image001.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On the home page the font within the body copy of the Q+A section, seems bigger than the font in the body copy of the main message above \u2018Veldhoen\u2019s mission..\u2019<br>&gt; What is the font being used for both the Q and the A section here?<br>&gt; The navigation bar text is very faint, can we make these the medium versions of these fonts?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image002.png&gt;\u2026 the top one is how it looks on the staging site compared to the current version below.<br>&gt; &lt;image003.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Meet our team:<br>&gt; can we see what its like with the Eau de Nil flowing across the page so the full width of the space is taken with the colour? Not separated out into cards? We could keep the words \u2018Meet our team\u2019 and countries with the white background.<br>&gt; The job titles are faint, can we have these in the medium version of that font?  (these are things I could help with, if I had access)<br>&gt; &lt;image004.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; What we do<br>&gt; Can we update the main header image to be a crop of the shutterstock image, with a navy overlay? It may not be right though, so how can I change these images myself?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image005.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Can we update the titles that are beside the + signs to our navy? We had asked for them to be in red but they didn\u2019t change, so if the subtitles are staying in teal please can we have the titles in navy<br>&gt; These titles also need to be slightly bigger than the subtitles, so would be great to know the font sizes being used throughout so we can identify what our options are<br>&gt; Also these subtitles don\u2019t need to be justified in terms of layout, as they look extremely spaced out when justified \u2013 see below<br>&gt; &lt;image006.png&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image007.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Explore our Work:<br>&gt; The font of the titles for each case study seem very big (as they do currently) so what size are these?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Browse Industry News:<br>&gt; The words \u2018Industry News\u2019 don\u2019t stay red when on that page, please can we update<br>&gt; Can we update the header image to be the one attached.. by Jacek-dylag (unsplash), with a navy tint\u2026 as per what you\u2019re using (or can you tell me how to update these images?)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image008.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The new future of work<br>&gt; Thanks for removing the extra \u2018read more\u2019 sections. Could we also still have the layout of the body copy and latest story image updated in size as requested, on the original brief? See notes below from Miro board.<br>&gt; Also re the headline size, would be good to decrease this in size\u2026 see below\u2026 this is where we need to be consistent with hierarchy of messaging\u2026 and where I can hop in and adjust if possible<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image009.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Case Study pages:<br>&gt; There are lots of inconsistencies in terms of font sizes between different case studies.. so where can I help? I\u2019m not sure if these sections have been fully completed yet, so apologies if the feedback below is covering work yet to be completed\u2026.<br>&gt; But if you look at the following screenshots of the first two case studies \u2013 they are different\u2026 the first has a really small subtitle in the trade gothic font, the other subhead is using the Soho Gothic font\u2026 We\u2019re working towards all headlines being in caps, so if these could be changed, then the subtitles to be a consistent size. I can update the headlines into caps if that helps, but let me know!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image010.png&gt;  &lt;image011.png&gt;<br>&gt; Also the quotes need to be in the Minion Pro italic font, but not caps.. the size of these quotes are now huge, so we need to consider the hierarchy of messaging again.<br>&gt; There are some coloured bars appearing on some pages<br>&gt; Spaces have appeared above the words for each section, can we tighten these up?<br>&gt; The words \u2018Project Gallery\u2019 are not being seen, could these be in the navy and in caps? There\u2019s also lots of space above these words that we don\u2019t need..<br>&gt; &lt;image012.png&gt;<br>&gt; The \u2018Contact\u2019 section at the bottom \u2013 can this Eau de Nil stretch across the width of the page as per requested above, so not appearing in little boxes?<br>&gt; The font in these sections needs to be updated to stand out clearly\u2026 e,g the word Asia could be in navy, the rest could be in the medium version of the font.<br>&gt; &lt;image013.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; In the Industry News section, when click through to individual stories:<br>&gt; Headline to be in caps<br>&gt; Subhead to be in navy caps and smaller than the headline.. goes back to having a clear hierarchy of messaging with our font sizes<br>&gt; Where we have contact details using the Eau de Nil background, we need to update the text to make the words stand out as best they can. Ref comments mentioned above. Also in this instance, the background colour to the photo has changed, please can we have this back to the original so the circle stands out?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image014.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Contact us:<br>&gt; Can we test the image here; to update it to the two attached? We\u2019re not sure how they will look with the navy overlay\u2026 or tell me how I can update these and I can test them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image015.png&gt;  or\u2026. &lt;image016.png&gt;  (forest image sent via wetransfer)<br>&gt; Can we have the Eau de Nil colour spread the width of the page?<br>&gt; The names of the different entities could all be in navy\u2026 keep the red \u2018+\u2019 as requested and shown (thank-you), but update the rest of the words each time to be navy<br>&gt; &lt;image017.png&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thanks Heath \u2013 appreciate your support with this, and again let me know how I can help when it comes to consistency!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Cheers<br>&gt; Una<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Una Mapes<br>&gt; Marketing Director<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image018.png&gt; &lt;https://www.veldhoencompany.com/en/&gt;<br>&gt; Veldhoen + Company PTY Ltd<br>&gt; +61 468 300 292   |   una@veldhoencompany.com &lt;mailto:una@veldhoencompany.com&gt;<br>&gt; Sydney                    |   www.veldhoencompany.com &lt;http://www.veldhoencompany.com/&gt;<br>&gt; Follow us on<br>&gt; &lt;image019.png&gt; &lt;https://www.facebook.com/VeldhoenCompany&gt; &lt;image020.png&gt; &lt;https://www.linkedin.com/company/veldhoen---company&gt; &lt;image021.png&gt; &lt;https://twitter.com/veldhoencompany&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;image022.png&gt; &lt;https://www.veldhoencompany.com/en/impact-of-activity-based-working-white-paper-download/&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land on which I work, the Dharug Nation, and pay my respects to Elders past and present.",
