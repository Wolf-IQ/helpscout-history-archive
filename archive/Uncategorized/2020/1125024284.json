We have quite a few hospitality sector clients that have been hit the worst, so we are helping where we can.\u00a0<br /><br />If we cancel/pause, it will mean your website will not be live... This is not ideal as we want you to 'stay online' at the very least. I can however offer a discount for 6 months until you get back on your feet again. I'll bring the monthly fee from $99 down to $30, a discount of approx 70%. I have been able to negotiate with our hosting partner (Google) on behalf of our clients. They have come to the party and provided assistance to us, which, I'm more than happy to pass on to our affected clients.\u00a0<br /><br />Let me know if this works for you? If not, I can archive the site and store it for when you are up and running again.\u00a0<br />",
