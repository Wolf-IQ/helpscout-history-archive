We've introduced two modes: Easy &amp; Advanced</strong><br>\nThis is great for agencies who configure the more complicated settings for their clients and then want to change to easy mode so their users aren't confused by any of the settings they don't need to change.</p>\n<p>- \ud83d\uddbc <strong>2. We've launched a completely new Image SEO module</strong><br>\nThe new Image SEO module builds upon the previous image-related functionality included with Rank Math and also now works flawlessly when paired with lazy-loading functionality.</p>\n<p>- \ud83d\udcaa <strong>3. We've strengthened the plugin further</strong><br>\nIn addition to a number of other query and performance-related improvements, we've also strengthened the plugin's security further so, as with every update, <strong>we highly recommend updating</strong>.</p>\n<p>- \ud83d\udcc8 <strong>4. We've made a number of other improvements</strong><br>\nThis update also includes improvements to the experience of adding focus keywords to posts as well as a series of other changes, such as improving the Breadcrumbs code for better accessibility, and <strong>overall improvements to make the plugin significantly faster than it was before</strong>. Also, we added WPML's complete compatibility, allowing editing of SEO details even if a post/page is set to NoIndex, error log shows up inside Rank Math if debugging is turned on, and many more.</p>\n<p>For all the other stuff - head over to our changelog:<br><em><a href=\"https://mythemeshoppteltd.cmail20.com/t/d-l-mdueg-jkjdjdjkm-y/\">https://rankmath.com/changelog/</a></em></p>\n<p><strong>Simply head over to your website's updates area and update it to the latest version.</strong> In case you were using the auto-update feature of Rank Math, your site should be updated to the latest version automatically.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy this update!</p>\n<p>With that said, <strong>if it isn't too much to ask for - would you mind leaving us a review?</strong><br><a href=\"https://mythemeshoppteltd.cmail20.com/t/d-l-mdueg-jkjdjdjkm-t/\">https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/seo-by-rank-math/reviews/#new-post</a></p>\n<p>It only takes a couple of minutes but helps us tremendously and would mean the world. \ud83c\udf0f</p>\n<p>And last but definitely not least, I also just appeared on Joe Howard (of WP Buffs) <em><strong><a href=\"https://mythemeshoppteltd.cmail20.com/t/d-l-mdueg-jkjdjdjkm-i/\">WPMRR podcast covering everything from the real story behind Rank Math</a></strong></em> as well and shared our thoughts on other plugins like Yoast &amp; All In One SEO. If you enjoyed the episode, consider leaving Joe a review on iTunes letting him know.
