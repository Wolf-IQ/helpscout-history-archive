            "body": "Hi Casey,\u00a0<br /><br />Hope you have been well : )<br /><br />This email address would have been changed back when we onboarded the website, however, there is a final step of clicking a confirmation link that was sent to:\u00a0support@tarabliss.com.au. I have just resent this again, if it's not in your spam/junk I suspect it may be being stopped by your email server. This sometimes happens because it's seen as suspicious due to the fact that an email is being sent form an @tarabliss.com.au email address that wasn't actually sent from your mail server.\u00a0<br /><br />We propose one of the following scenarios:\u00a0<br /><br /><ol><li>If the email has been received to support@tarabliss.com.au this time, then we are all good.\u00a0</li><li>If the email hasn't been received we can contact Rob from Lanter (assuming you are still with them) and see if he can find it in a spam filter somewhere deeper</li><li>Or if you like, we can simply enter our support@wpperk.com address as the admin email. It's only used to send WordPress related update notices etc.</li></ol>Also, please note, the fact that it's the old company's email account doesn't create any security issues etc. as it's not technically an 'account', so they have no access. <br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts?\u00a0 Option 3 is generally the best option.\u00a0",
