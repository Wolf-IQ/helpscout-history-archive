Webhooks are used to notify your server about events that happen in your Stripe account, such as a payout completing or an invoice being created. The failing webhook endpoint is https://staging-msra.kinsta.com/?callback=gravityformsstripe.<br><br>You or someone on your team has added that endpoint in your Stripe webhook settings, which you can view and edit here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks.<br><br>Please note that in most cases a failing webhook does not impact your payments or payouts. However, if you use subscriptions we rely on your webhook endpoint to notify you of new invoices. These invoices may be delayed for up to three days if your webhook is unable to successfully receive them. If you use Checkout, you may be handling the `checkout.session.completed` event as part of your purchase fulfillment process as described here: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/fulfillment#webhooks. If you do, failure to handle these events may interfere with purchase fulfillment.<br><br>We\u2019ve attempted to notify the endpoint 4 times since April 1, 2020 at 01:38AM. If this endpoint is important to your application, please try and fix the issue. If you do not need the webhook endpoint you can delete it from your Stripe webhook settings. We will stop sending notifications to your webhook by April 10, 2020 around 01:38AM.<br><br>Here is the summary of errors we have received when sending you webhooks:<br>* 4 requests could not connect to the server associated with the Webhook.<br><br>You need to return anything between a HTTP 200 to 299 for the webhook to be considered successfully delivered.<br>For more details on the errors, you can find your events page here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events.<br><br>You can also always review the history of webhooks and failed request logs right from your dashboard: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events.<br><br>For more in depth information about how to use webhooks, we recommend taking a look at our documentation: https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks.<br><br>Yours,<br><br>The Stripe team",
