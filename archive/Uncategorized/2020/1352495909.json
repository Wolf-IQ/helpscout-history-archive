This tends to create overlaps and introduce security issues. It's quite difficult to reverse engineer as we are not across the business requirements or history. This means we can't simply 'turn elements off' as we don't know if they are still required or not.\u00a0</li><li>The many plugins represent a potential security threat for the website to get hacked. They are like leaving a house or car window unlocked... An open invitation of sorts. Many of the plugins are not actively maintained by the developers/owners of the plugin code so will become vulnerable at one point or another. It's not a case of maybe, but a case of when.\u00a0</li><li>The site is extremely slow, particularly in the backend. We can speed this up, but the main cause of the slowness is from the plugins that have been installed as 'band aids' to either enhance the security, add some sort of feature or to cover up a gap. It's nearly impossible to efficiently work on a website that is in this condition.\u00a0</li></ul>My advice would be to have a consultation with the client to determine the key features that the website requires. You can then look to start fresh and rebuild from the ground up with the full business case or picture in mind. This way only the required features and functionality make the cut and the rest are left behind. Depending on the business case, either Shopify or WooCommerce will work for this client as they have a fairly traditional ecomm model. There is nothing too complex about buy/building their products online.\u00a0<br /><br />We spent 8 hrs yesterday trying to find some ways to make this work for them, but, I feel that with this clients sales volume and online success, it's too risky to add more bandaids. Although totally 'do-able', I would not be honestly setting them up for future success and that didn't sit well with myself and my team.\u00a0<br /><br />I do wish you and ATG all the best and of course, I'm here as a resource to bounce ideas etc.\u00a0",

Reason being, that they are getting up to 5-6 orders an hour and we don't want to miss any of them, or have someone part way through an order and then get bumped.\u00a0<br /><br />The downtime would be approx 30mins - 1hr and we can do it after hours when less shoppers will be online. Does this work for you/the client?\u00a0<br /><br />The alternative would to pay for some premium plugins to import and export the orders that come through during the migration period. This would result in a couple of minutes of downtime (max), but the plugins are circa $158USD.\u00a0<br /><br />Please let me know your preference? Happy to chat further about this also.",

Please see attached and let me know which option will be best for us to use.\u00a0<br /><br />Also, do you know if the website is hosting with GoDaddy as well? We have tried our normal way of cloning the site, but it's in such bad shape that it's maxing out the current server's resources. We will need to take a copy via FTP. So if you have the FTP details, can you please send them over to me also? Or if it's hosted with GoDaddy, once I'm in there I can retrieve them myself.<br /><br />Feel free to call if the above needs clarification.",

Happy to say we would like to proceed ahead.\n\nBefore doing so, I was about to make payment and saw there is a 12 month minimum term for the Pro Plan. Can we please make that a 3 month minimum term as a trial? The reason for that is because we want to mitigate the risk on our end and the company has had a bad experience before being locked into an agreement.\n\nAll help is appreciated here to get this over the line.\n\n====\n\nIn the meantime, below are my notes from the call. If there is anything that is correct please let me know:\n\nOnboarding process - Consolidating and cleaning up the site to get the plugins working and loading as quick as possible.\n\nSupport\n\n<ul><li>If we need anything added to the site we need to go through WP Perk.</li>\n<li>Anything 30mins and under is done on the same business day.</li>\n<li>2hrs per month of developer time each month. Overage fee is $99 per hour but they'll let us know beforehand.</li>\n</ul>\nMaintenance - 1st of each month we get a report detailing all the work that has been done.\n\nTeam of 10 people and we'll be dealing with either Heath, Reeka or Joel. Heath is in charge of all client onboarding.\n\n<strong>Kurt Sorensen</strong>\nDirector - Backpack Digital",
