This can be done with Google My Business Post (or series of posts)<br>One restaurant is buying meat and seafood from their wholesalers and selling them to retail customers online (with minimum order quantities)<br>Just generally putting a message up on the website to say that you are open for trade and subtly that we all need to continue to support local businesses to reduce economic impact<br>Some clients have removed unessential contractors (such as cleaners) and delegated these tasks to full-timers to reduce overhead, but also keep as many team members as possible.<br><br>Some ideas:<br><br>Reconfiguring the seating plan to make sure sufficient space in between patrons and encourage the message of social distancing (diners will definitely tell their friends and family about this which may lead to more bookings)<br>Shorten your service hours to reduce your overhead and spend the extra time cleaning hard surfaces (and use this as part of your marketing).<br>Sell items in the restaurant that people can take home as we are all spending more time at home. Think luxury things like a family tiramisu, crusty loaves of bread as well as longer life items such as your blend of coffee, biscotti, gelato etc.<br>Park a Vespa out the front (until someone tells you to move it) with some sort of \u2018we are delivering\u2019 signage<br>Include sanitiser in highly visible areas (it\u2019s practical and will help to put diners at ease)<br><br>Hope this helps, let me know what you are doing that is / does work as well.<br><br>And of course let me know if we can add any messages etc to the website. We are working almost around the clock at the moment until the \u2019new normal\u2019 starts to happen.<br><br>Hang in there and speak soon,<br>Heath Maguire<br>Director<br><br>E. heath@wpperk.com  &lt;mailto:heath@wpperk.com&gt;  |  P. 1300 072 134  |  M. 0415 162 271<br><br>&lt;https://wpperk.com/&gt;<br><br><br>On 21 Mar 2020, at 9:15 am, Machiavelli &lt;info@machiavelli.com.au &lt;mailto:info@machiavelli.com.au&gt;&gt; wrote:<br><br><br>Hi Heath<br>Hope all is well ..<br>I would like to add something on our page regarding steps we are taking during this period of outbreak...<br>Can you give me a feed back what other business are doing on their website In particular the hospitality industry ...<br>I have send a couple of emails to our customers keeping them updated on the precautionary steps we have put into place and services we have introduced ...<br>I will forward you the document This evening when I get back into the office.<br>Look forward in hearing from you soon<br><br>Kind Regards<br>Rosanna",
