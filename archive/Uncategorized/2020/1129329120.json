I the users won't need that section then yes, we can hide it.\u00a0</li></ul><br />Regarding the other question, I found it in spam! Sorry! <br /><br />Sounds like that could work. We can filter out the posts that you don't want to show in the generic area. Just assign them to a common category and then we can code it along the lines of IF categoryxyz THEN don't show HERE. <br /><br />Hope that makes sense?",

Just wondering if this will always load with a quantity of 3 when someone clicks through. It's done that every time I've clicked on it, just making sure people don't see $297 as the price. Also, could we change the font to mostly a freight style bar the main headings? Having everything in the font that it is is a bit much for the eyes.<br><br>With this - how would people then change their billing details/manage their subscription after the fact? I am looking on the 'my profile' page and only seeing the basics.

Ideally it would be centered, can you please take a look for us?</li>\n<li>We've been having a look at the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions-gifting/\">possibility of \"gifting\" subscriptions</a> but the reviews on this doesn't look ideal.. but it's 2 years old... thoughts? Do you have experience with this and if we did install it, would we treat it any differently in active campaign? And finally, how long would it push the tech side of the site from being ready?</li>\n<li>Also one final question, when someone has purchased the campfire, we want redirect them to a specific campfire thank you page, is that all possible?</li>\n</ul>\nThanks Heath, looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nEm",

A quick one for you (I hope).\n\nIs there any harm with me setting up tags and automations in Active Campaign that will be used when WooCommerce is a go? For example, we're launching a new online program which you know about.\n\nAutomations I am looking to setup:\n\n<ul><li>Abandon cart email</li>\n<li>Payment fail email (is this necessary)?</li>\n<li>Welcome email</li>\n<li>And probably a few others that pertain the the campaign that I can't remember.</li>\n</ul>\nI can't think of a reason there would be a problem to start doing this within Active Campaign and then actually get Woo Commerce to add the tags on form submission once you've set it all up, but I wanted to check.\n\nThanks,\nEm",

Generally within WordPress there is one 'batch' of comments for each individual post. With the current format, we would need to build something quite bespoke to enable the users to comment on the individual sections. I can look into it further for you, my estimate would be 15-20hours of dev work.\u00a0</li><li>The instagram widget, that link is not working for us either. Can you send me the Instagram logins so we can connect it manually.\u00a0</li></ul>There will be a small invoice for the extra WooCommerce work, we will tally it up, but currently sitting at approx 1 hr.\u00a0<br />",

I went to create a page for this and discovered we already had one on hand. Link is here:\n\nhttps://tarabliss.com.au/soundbytes-for-your-spirit/\n\nAlso just checking on other existing matters:\n\n<ul><li>WooCommerce - how we are able to articulate the subscription. Is it correct to say \"1 upfront payment upon registration, followed by recurring membership payments to be deducted every 3 consecutive months.\"</li>\n<li>The discussion box under sections - are we able to execute on this or is there another solution we should be looking at to have community engagement in house?</li>\n<li>The Instagram widget, what do I need to do to fix this?</li>\n</ul>\n\nAnd a new one:\n\n<ul><li>On The Campfire sales page we're only going to be using a single panel on the price block. The way this was previously designed was that we could choose to have either one or two panels showing (Standard and then a bonus payment plan for example) But for some reason when I hide the second panel now it doesn't centre the remaining panel and instead keeps it to the left. There's no apparent option to change this on the front of it. Can you help?</li>\n</ul>\n\nAlso just wanting to check where we are at currently with our dev hours tally. I know we only get a couple included each month - do you need to invoice us?\n\nCheers,\n\nCasey\nBLISS SUPPORT\n\ne. support@tarabliss.com.au\nw. tarabliss.com.au\n\nCourage | Creation | Collaborative Leadership\n\ndoTERRA Presidential Diamond | Author | 'Rebels of Light'",
