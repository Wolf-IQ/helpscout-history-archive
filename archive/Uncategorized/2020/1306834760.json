We sold under auction conditions with over 8 people registered. Before we started the campaign the owners had a price expectation in mind, however after the first open house with the furniture styling the price expectation increased. We ended up selling for nearly $100,000 over the original price expectation \u2013 so a big thank you to you & the team at Advantage.\" MANAGING DIRECTOR, REAL ESTATE AGENT<br><br>\u200bStyle to live<br>\u201cWOW WOW WOW! We love what the Advantage team have achieved for us. We were overwhelmed when we saw the transformation, it\u2019s beautiful! The colours are great, it\u2019s smart and comfortable. I can\u2019t believe how good my photography looks now that it's up on the wall! We can\u2019t believe it\u2019s our home! Well done and thank you, we couldn\u2019t be happier with the result.\u201d \u2013 Sally & Glenn Warren, Cronulla House Project<br><br><br>Style to sell<br>\"We love what you have done and it looks absolutely amazing.  Your service and care is wonderful. My congratulations and thanks to you and your team at Advantage for the services you provided. The decor was well suited to my apartment and the timely and careful installation and removal of the furniture was greatly appreciated. I would have no hesitation to recommend Advantage Property Styling.\"\u2013 PROPERTY VENDOR, MOSMAN<br><br>\u200bStyle to sell<br>\"We were successful in selling the house pre-auction over our personal reserve and believe that the return on the investment from the styling costs was well and truly worthwhile.  Not only did you do a fabulous job with the styling, you and your team were incredibly professional and lovely to deal with at all times.\" \u2013 PROPERTY VENDOR, MARRICKVILLE<br><br>\u200bStyle to live<br>\u201cWe engaged Advantage Interior Design for professional input to furnish and style our home as we felt overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know where to begin. The team were very organised, making the entire process easy and I received guidance right the way through from style, colour to textures and how all the pieces would all work together. We are so pleased with the end result, everything looks great.\u201d North Shore House Project<br><br>Style to live<br>\u201cAdvantage Property Styling styled the apartment when it was on the market so I decided to reach out to their Interior Design team who tailored the furnishings and colour palette to suit my needs and lifestyle. Ashleigh and Natalie listened to my brief and worked closely with me to create a contemporary, yet timeless, and comfortable space.\u201d Albert T, Barangaroo Apartment Project<br><br>Style to sell<br>\"We had a great campaign and went to Auction on Saturday.

We had a broad idea of what we wanted but needed someone to bring it all together with vision and creativity.  Brianna and Luisa were a delight to work with, they not only provided the vision but challenged us to move a little outside our comfort zone in a really good way. They also respected our budget and our tight timeline. The result is stunning, a very stylish, cohesive look and at the same time, very comfortable and liveable.\u201d A Rigby, Elvina Bay House Project<br><br>INSTAGRAM LOGIN:<br>Advtantage_interiors<br>Styling1<br><br>Changes:<br>I\u2019ve attached the branding guidelines \u2013 if you can make sure that all font is in the darker grey not black and also the buttons to switch to the darker grey when the cursor hovers.<br>COPY UPDATE under services section \u2013 change Quality And Consistency to Quality and Consistency<br>Change to Interior Design<br><br>In the footer can you put Advantage Pay Later link under services section<br><br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br>Madeleine Ryan<br>Social and Digital Marketing Manager<br>Advantage Property Styling and Interior Design<br><br><br><br><br>Follow us on:<br>&lt;https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FAdvantageStyling%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cmadeleine%40advantagestyling.com.au%7C439439a49b404d6e7cbe08d822f03ec0%7C990eae31a9404d14b2ac18d698fa2459%7C1%7C0%7C637297762527846157&sdata=QgzwgD8vrWE962d3hr4K9XiN0fEEMVaRwOZs0%2BQTzDQ%3D&reserved=0&gt;  &lt;https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fadvantagestyling%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cmadeleine%40advantagestyling.com.au%7C439439a49b404d6e7cbe08d822f03ec0%7C990eae31a9404d14b2ac18d698fa2459%7C1%7C0%7C637297762527846157&sdata=8lD7fk4bcdiOawm0nkZk%2FsU6%2Ffd2CqgLXOguzrLd2b4%3D&reserved=0&gt;<br><br>M 0420 301 408 | P 02 9310 1611<br>Tenancy 1, Unit 1, 14A Baker Street, BANKSMEADOW NSW 2019<br>www.advantagestyling.com.au &lt;https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.advantagestyling.com.au%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cmadeleine%40advantagestyling.com.au%7C439439a49b404d6e7cbe08d822f03ec0%7C990eae31a9404d14b2ac18d698fa2459%7C1%7C0%7C637297762527856151&sdata=2%2FE3Vp%2BLNGD5pajMrt4dllqlfn%2FuWrSSBn%2BpOZnWiUQ%3D&reserved=0&gt;<br><br>&lt;https://aus01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fadvantagestyling.com.au%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cmadeleine%40advantagestyling.com.au%7C439439a49b404d6e7cbe08d822f03ec0%7C990eae31a9404d14b2ac18d698fa2459%7C1%7C0%7C637297762527866152&sdata=oOciCtlSoGokeu1X5Haxffz%2FYqGgj4cbxBh2ioXFdHc%3D&reserved=0&gt;",
