Olive and avocado oils are not ideal for frying like this as the oils denature at a lower temperature.<br>\nFried on an induction hob in wok.<br>\nThe overall impression tastewise is this leans dominantly to vinegar, using Asian rice vinegar. It's ok, but that note is too strong. I'd go 1/8 cup next time, not 1.4. I will ensure my pyrex cup measure is accurate too. I just went by the stencil on the side.<br>\nNext, salt flake conversion to ground rock salt online suggested 2:1,ie 1/4 tsp rock vis a vis 1/2 flakes. Too low. You can tell when you taste the freshly cooked battered chicken pieces, not salty enough. Flakes are not as easy to get where I am and more expensive, but maybe next time will use instead.<br>\nI used tamari and a Thai sweet chilli brand. Overall, pretty good. I don't think you need to evenly coat the batter by dunking the chicken back in the sauce. I think drenching it on the serving plate or bowls would be better, as it allows some crunch here and there. (I did both).<br>\nChicken is cooked when batter is golden. I did 2 batches within the 600g and think that approach is better than rigid timing, especially with breast, but worked fine in both cases, just better with a \"golden\" approach.<br>\nThis is a 4 star recipe but deserves a 5 because I really like you for your inviting site and making recipes simple and easy to follow. That wins.<br>\n<br>\nApprove it: https://simplehomeedit.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=approve&amp;c=5135#wpbody-content<br>\nTrash it: https://simplehomeedit.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=trash&amp;c=5135#wpbody-content<br>\nSpam it: https://simplehomeedit.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=spam&amp;c=5135#wpbody-content<br>\nCurrently 366 comments are waiting for approval.
