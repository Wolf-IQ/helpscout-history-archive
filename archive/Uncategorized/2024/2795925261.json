She has stolen from various tenants in this complex, broken into my own home and stolen my belongings, committed assault on myself, steals all my mail, damages my property continuously, stalks intimidates and harasses myself and my child aswell as has numerous drug affected persons entering in and out of her property at all hours of the night and day and is involved in a number of other incidents where the quiet enjoyment of all the other neighbours is affected and disrupted with loud music yelling and various drug affected men hanging around the property and making it an unsafe environment for others.<br>\nI have a personal violence order against her which has been enforced by the police after numerous criminal reports have been made in regards to her conduct. Her name is Natalie Brown or Grace Natalie cook.<br>\nShe has now been formally found guilty and charged with the assault she committed against me in the common area of the complex we both reside at as I was trying to make my way to the safety of my home.<br>\nThe police have completed a support letter and have been in communication with the housing manager Amber who is very much aware of the situation and has been given all necessary information and evidence of the incident as well as all the other criminal conduct that the other tenant has been harassing me and my child with.<br>\nTo date I have received no support from Amber whatsoever in terms of checking on mine and my child's well-being despite continuing to report on the effect this neighbor is having on my safety and wellbeing. I have also continued to ask for updates about when this tenant will be stopped and removed from the property as she continues to harass me and disregard any form of being a good neighbor as she continues to invade my privacy and my rights to quiet and peaceful enjoyment as well as mine and my child's need to feel safe in our own home.<br>\nMy child and I are domestic abuse victims and survivors and I have been diagnosed with PTSD and trauma aswell as my son and I've informed Amber of having to see a DR due to the harassment and being put on a mental health plan due to the sever depression anxiety and feeling completely and utterly defenceless and disregarded even despite what women's housing company strives to do, which is to keep women and children safe and give them a safe place to be able to call home and support them in the endeavor to achieve this, however amber has at times failed to even respond to my messages and cries for help In this situation and my last request for a response with an update after the court found the other tenant guilty of assault on myself resulting in a criminal charge against her which I'm aware is when women's housing are able to take action on the removal of the tenant due to the threat she poses to myself as well as all other residents within the property, yet I received a response from Amber incorrectly informing me that it was a civil matter and that she couldn't tell me anything due to the other tenants privacy and that I could email her more evidence of I wish but to follow up with police instead. However the police have been informed every step of the way and I have all event numbers for the numerous incidents that have occurred as well as I asked for a response in the plans that were being put in place to support myself and my child's safety so I'm unsure as to why that constituted the need to protect the other tenants privacy? I also am very much aware that this matter is actual not a civil matter whatsoever it is a criminal matter where the police have issues a personal violence order on my behalf against the other tenant successfully as well as achieved a guilty verdict and therefore a criminal conviction against her for the assault she committed against me.<br>\nI also have informed Amber that I need all communication to be sent via email to me as well as the tenant continuously steals any and all of my mail and damages the complex property by breaking open my letterbox almost daily and I haven't been able to receive any mail in almost 6 months. She has also now stolen not one but two of my drivers license out of my mailbox, the first one and then as I had to report it to police as being stolen and received an event number for the incident in order to reissue another one to be sent out to me, only to have that one be stolen by her as well, which has now left me with no form of photo id and I am under the assumption she is intending to commit identity fraud in my name.<br>\nAt my own expense I've now had to acquire a PO BOX in order to try to combat the issue but it just seems like everything I have to do is leaving me completely isolated and severely affecting my mental health as I continue waking up everyday trying to to be strong and doing whatever I can to make sure my child's safety is of utmost importance.<br>\nI've started to compile a list of all incidents which I have been keeping notes on and any and all event numbers for the conduct of this women and all breaches of the strata by laws as well as that of the women's housing bylaws that she continues to break and will have a succinct document that will include all other necessary information about the breaches and impedement of mine and my son's safety in the coming days which I'm happy to email through to wherever necessary I will just need to know where to send it.<br>\nThis is in no way a complaint against women's housing and what your amazing company has achieved and does for women and I can't thank women's housing enough for allowing my son and I to finally have a place we can call home however it is more a complaint about feeling completely unsupported and there being not traction whatsoever in the handling of abother women's housing tenant who has done nothing but break every rule in which are put in place to ensure everyone's safety and enjoyment of their homes.<br>\nAlso my PO box address where I can receive any and all mail and communication safely is :<br>\n<br>\nPO Box 111<br>\n<br>\nWestmead, NSW 2145<br>\n<br>\nOr<br>\n<br>\nSuite 111<br>\n<br>\nShop 206 166-174 Hawkesbury Road<br>\n<br>\nWestmead, NSW 2145<br>\n<br>\nIf this could be put in the system and updated in order for my mail not to be intercepted that would be very much appreciated<br>\n<br>\nKind regards,<br>\n<br>\nBrittany Stafford</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>",
