NO baking, as its already cooked !!! No vegies in it, that wld spoil texture of that meat, and no other flavours need adding,, but vegies ssrved beside, -Beef will not give you that delicate sweet flavour of the Lamb roasted, and the tender delicious texture of that meat,, You have to try this,,, Beef is a tougher stronger meat,, - AND there is no long list of ingredients as there are for COTTAGE PIE, and no Frying Mince meat from butcher either, -1940's War Years I turned the handle of Granmas mincer that she had screwed to her kitchen table, and I watched her make our SHEPHERDS PIE, with left overs, as she told us the German history of it,, I am happy to answer any questions about it, /- memories for me as she brought out her delicious milk puddings she baked in her big black stove, stoked with wood, the big water urn sat on top giving hot water as needed for cuppas,,, they were tough years,,,,Roast Rabbit, pickled Mutton, Jellied Lamb Tongue, Brains Pancakes, etc, all home made and delicious,,<br>\nJellied Tin fruits, home made cordials, syrup dumplings, sponge cakes -- etc etc ,,,<br>\n<br>\nApprove it: https://simplehomeedit.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=approve&amp;c=4293#wpbody-content<br>\nTrash it: https://simplehomeedit.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=trash&amp;c=4293#wpbody-content<br>\nSpam it: https://simplehomeedit.com/wp-admin/comment.php?action=spam&amp;c=4293#wpbody-content<br>\nCurrently 344 comments are waiting for approval.
