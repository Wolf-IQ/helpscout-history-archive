The team may be reading the line item amount which is indeed Ex GST.<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However the GST components are added after the 'Sub total'.<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. The team may be seeing the paypal payout figure somewhere of $218.66<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for this order. So $6.14 less. This amount is the paypal processing fee.<br><br><br>I hope this helps to clarify, but from the website side of things, it<br>appears to be billing as expected without any GST issues. Feel free to give<br>me a buzz on 0415 162 271 to run through in more detail.<br><br><br>Thanks and speak soon,<br><br>[image: heath-maguire.png]<br>Heath MaguireCreative Director<br>Wolf IQ Pty Ltd<br>[image: phone-icon-2x.png] 1300 072 134 &lt;13002007220134&gt; | 0415 162 271<br>&lt;04152016220271&gt;<br>[image: email-icon-2x.png] heath@wolfiq.com.au<br>[image: link-icon-2x.png] wolfiq.com.au &lt;//wolfiq.com.au&gt;<br>[image: address-icon-2x.png] Level 2, 383 George Street, Sydney NSW 2000<br>[image: wolf-logo.png]<br>[image: linkedin] &lt;https://au.linkedin.com/in/heathmaguire&gt;<br>We'd love to hear from you.
