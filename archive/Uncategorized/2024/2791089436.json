A traineeship is designed for people who want to learn while they are working, providing a pathway to develop practical experience and a nationally recognised qualification.  A traineeship is typically 12 to 24 months in duration.<br>\n<br>\nTrainees will receive ongoing support from their dedicated METS Trainer and Assessor. Our trainers offer regular check-ins, face to face visits, Team training sessions and progress updates to both trainee and employer. <br>\n<br>\nOn completion, trainees will receive a Nationally Recongnised Qualification. <br>\n<br>\nTraineeships options are<br>\n<br>\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm;\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"ex-\">New Entrant Traineeships</li>\n<li class=\"ex-\">Existing Worker Traineeships</li>\n<li class=\"ex-\">School Based Apprenticeships &amp; Traineeships SBAT traineeships </li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIn most cases, the trainee and employer may be eligible to receive incentives from the Commonwealth Government *Eligibility Criteria applies.

They may also qualify if they are within the first 12 months of a part-time employment arrangement or within 3 months of completing a pre-requisite qualification. Like any traineeship, your trainee will gain on the job experience whilst completing a qualification and will receive support and feedback throughout the duration of their studies. New Entrant Traineeships are available for almost all of METS qualifications, as long as the student is eligible for this kind of study. <br>\nTo be eligible for a New Entrant Traineeship a student must:<br>\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm;\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"ex-\">Be an Australian Citizen or Permanent Resident</li>\n<li class=\"ex-\">Have worked for less than 3 months full time or 12 months part time with their current employer or have completed the pre-requisite qualification less than 3 months prior.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<b></b><p><b> </b></p><b></b><br>\n<b>Existing Worker Traineeships</b><br>\nWhere a person is not eligible to be classified as a new entrant trainee, but still wishes to undertake a traineeship, they will be classified as an Existing Worker Trainee. Like any traineeship, your employee will gain on the job experience whilst completing a qualification and will receive support and feedback from both you and METS throughout the duration of their studies. However, unlike New Entrant Traineeships, the NSW State Government does not fund METS for Existing Worker Traineeships and therefore we must invoice you or your employer to cover the training costs. In most cases the incentives the employer receives from the Commonwealth Government will offset these costs. To be eligible for an Existing Worker Traineeship a student must:<br>\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm;\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"ex-\">Be an Australian Citizen or Permanent Resident</li>\n<li class=\"ex-\">Have worked for more than 3 months full time or 12 months part time with their current employer or have completed the pre-requisite qualification more than 3 months prior  </li>\n</ul>\nTraining costs for Existing Worker Traineeships are invoiced to the employer by METS Training Services in 3 intervals and are in most cases offset by incentives. Further to this, an enrolment fee applies, with a bond being returned from this fee upon successful completion of the qualification.<br>\n<b></b><p><b> </b></p><b></b><br>\n<span style=\"background:#FF0;\">(add in)</span><br>\n<b>School Based Apprenticeships &amp; Traineeships (SBAT) </b><br>\nSBAT training provide learners the opportunity to complete a Nationally Recognised Vocational Education and Training (VET) Qualification while completing their Higher School Certificate (HSC). SBATs are available to all Year 10, 11 and 12 high school students in NSW and provide the opportunity to learn and earn. Learners are supported by their employer and RTO to be flexible with their HSC curriculum. <br>\nMETS offer SBAT Traineeships in:<br>\n\u2022 SIR20216 Certificate II in Retail Services <br>\n\u2022 SIR30216 Certificate III in Retail <br>\n\u2022 CHC30121 Certificate III in Early Childhood Education and Care<br>\n<b></b><p><b> </b></p><b></b><br>\n<b></b><p><b> </b></p><b></b><br>\n<b></b><p><b> </b></p><b></b><br>\n<b>Employment-Based on the job Training</b><br>\nEmployer-based training is an excellent way to upskill your staff. With METS, your team benefits from regular, in-person visits by our professional and qualified trainers. METS deliver training and assessments on-site, ensuring personalised, high-quality support tailored to your workplace needs.<br>\n<b></b><p><b> </b></p><b></b><br>\n<b></b><p><b> </b></p><b></b><br>\n<b>How does METS Employment based training work?</b><br>\nOnce a traineeship is approved, trainees gain immediate access to our online Learner Management System (LMS), providing instant access to their learning materials. A qualified METS trainer will then contact the trainee to schedule their first face-to-face visit and explain the traineeship process in detail.<br>\n<br>\nDuring the face-to-face visits, trainers will cover a range of training:<br>\nAssisting with questions<br>\nProviding feedback <br>\nAssisting with assessments<br>\nProviding direction on practical assessments<br>\nCompleting observation tasks<br>\nConsultation with trainee and manager    <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe ensure that each trainee receives comprehensive training, gaining a thorough understanding of every unit of competency within their qualification. This approach ensures that both theoretical knowledge and practical skills align with the National Standards.<br>\n<b></b><p><b> </b></p><b></b><br>\n<b>Does an employment-based traineeship cost extra?</b><br>\nNo, METS will not charge you additional cost to visit trainees within the workplace <br>\n<br>\n<b>Will trainees receive support in between trainer visits?</b><br>\nAbsolutely. We've been told by hundreds of our happy clients that they choose us because of our personable nature, quality training programs &amp; one-on-one support. It's training with a difference!<br>\nOur learners can reach our trainers via phone, text, email and our 24 hour live chat-bot. <br>\nTrainees can book in additional online team meetings in between visits  <br>\n<br>\n<b>I have a staff member with specific learning needs. Can METS give them extra support?</b><br>\nOf course! Just let us know at the time of enrolment and we'll take care of the rest. If your trainee discovers difficulties part way through their traineeship, we'll also be happy to explore what additional assistance may be available. Just be sure to let us know!<br>\n<br>\n<b>Can METS cater to trainees from non-english speaking backgrounds?</b><br>\nAll METS course materials are written in an accessible format. And naturally, as your trainee will receive visits from their METS trainer, they'll have the opportunity to clarify their understanding of the course work face to face. On top of all of this, your trainee may be offered the opportunity to clarify their theory responses with their trainer/assessor and possibly establish competency based on a combination of written and verbal assessment.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Does METS offer recognition of prior learning and credit transfer?</b><br>\nWe certainly do. If your trainee has received competency in a current unit of their qualification previously, or have 12 months of full time  or more years on the floor experience working in the sector, METS is able to assist you with working towards a qualification via <a href=\"https://mets.edu.au/ways-to-learn/recognition-of-prior-learning/\"><b>Recognition of Prior Learning</b></a>.<br>\n<br>\n<span style=\"background:#FF0;\">(Add in)</span><br>\n<b>How to get started</b><br>\nContact METS on 02 9838 0567 or email <a href=\"mailto:metstrainingau@gmail.com\">metstrainingau@gmail.com</a> <br>\nWe will provide step by step support<br>\n<br>\n</div>\n<p style=\"font-family:Arial;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Segoe UI';\" id=\"ex-c1-id-7\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;color:#464141;\" id=\"ex-c1-id-8\"><strong id=\"ex-c1-id-9\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">Lana Wheeler</span><span style=\"font-weight:bolder;font-size:13.3333px;\"></span><br>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(84,188,225);\">METS RTO Manager</span></strong></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Arial;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Segoe UI';\"><span id=\"ex-c1-id-11\" style=\"font-size:10pt;color:#464141;\"><strong id=\"ex-c1-id-18\" style=\"color:rgb(84,188,225);\"><span style=\"color:rgb(84,188,225);\">T</span>: </strong></span></span><span style=\"font-family:'Segoe UI';\"><span style=\"color:rgb(70,65,65);\"><span id=\"ex-c1-id-22\" style=\"font-size:10pt;\"></span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;color:rgb(0,0,0);\">028378 7722</span></span></span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Segoe UI';\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;color:#464141;\"><strong style=\"color:rgb(84,188,225);\"><br style=\"color:rgb(84,188,225);\" />\nM: </strong></span></span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:'Segoe UI';\">0481 069 908</span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Segoe UI';\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;color:#464141;\"><strong style=\"color:rgb(84,188,225);\"><br style=\"color:rgb(84,188,225);\" />\nE: </strong></span></span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;color:rgb(31,73,125);font-family:'Segoe UI';\"><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">LWheeler@mets.edu.au</span></span><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Segoe UI';\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;color:#464141;\"><strong><br>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(84,188,225);\">W:</span> <a href=\"https://mets.edu.au/\" title=\"mets.edu.au\">mets.edu.au</a> </strong></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Arial;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Segoe UI';\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;color:#464141;\"><strong style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);\">104 Vanessa St, Kingsgrove, NSW 2208</strong></span></span></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;\" align=\"left\"><img src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/9fb7abd693a4ed454bb5cb7095fb67d5898c19b3/e45c96ea03815d9aaff28d6fd08bd398c664efb9/mets_email-signature-03(002)_8eadf421-5d75-4f7c-9639-352e8dd322a3.png\" border=\"0\" id=\"ex-0.p08xqfc2ojb\" alt=\"METS_Email-Signature-03 (002).png\" style=\"font-size:12px;width:641px;height:110px;\" width=\"641\" height=\"110\" /><strong style=\"font-size:10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:10pt;font-family:'Segoe UI';color:#464141;\"> <br></span></strong><img src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/e54c2a8a5e00fc8a3e390914aa7590e2be4d5d41/ba2cc16f321a67a1764abcbe352f3bd41b010523/metssubsignature_7003e06f-b9d8-47a5-b5ae-743c184b9fc8.png\" border=\"0\" id=\"ex-0.nc33rpdr2z\" alt=\"METS sub signature.PNG\" width=\"662\" height=\"53\" style=\"width:662px;height:53px;\" /></p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:10pt;color:#666;\"><b>Disclaimer</b></p>\n<p style=\"font-family:Verdana;font-size:8pt;color:#666;\">The information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.
