There would only be very rare circumstances where we would suggest using an alternative, e.g., a subdomain.<br><br>2. Not as yet. However, these are relatively straightforward to create with the contact form above the fold.<br><br>3. Sure thing. We recommend creating the content first. This means the layout can be adjusted to allow for all the key information required on the landing page, rather than adjusting the content to the \u201clayout\u201d. I will outline the process below.<br><br>4. Of course. Once the content is supplied, we require approximately 1-3 hours per page. This depends on the complexity of the content and various elements. Dr Pant can use his website support inclusions for these updates.<br><br><br>New Landing Page/s Process<br><br>1. Apalka to supply content - I have prepared a Google Doc landing page template/guide to follow using some content found here: https://sydneyshoulderunit.com.au/procedures/broken-collarbone/<br><br>The template can be accessed and edited here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kt8msz0veI3MCZkqKMJazHhuf44h6Qoh0q9Smy7M4lY/edit?usp=sharing<br><br>2.  Wolf IQ to create landing page/s - We will use your supplied content along with the Sydney Shoulder Unit-approved design elements to create the landing and then share them with you for feedback.<br><br>3. Wolf IQ to create thank you pages - We create thank you pages and share them for your approval.<br><br>4.

We want to test landing pages specifically designed for shoulder problems to improve the conversion rate.<br>&gt; We've some questions:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; - Could you please confirm whether we can host these landing pages under the current website? We don't want to use a third-party tool (i.e. Unbounce) at this stage.<br>&gt; - Could you please let us know if we have any page layouts that we can utilise for this purpose? We need to ensure that we have the contact form above the fold.<br>&gt; - I believe that once we finalise the layout, you'll ask us to provide the content. Could you please give more info on the process? How long would it take to publish a landing page?<br>&gt; - Lastly, would you please send Dr Pant a quote for this project?
