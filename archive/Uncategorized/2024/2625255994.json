            "body": "Hi Josephine, <br><br>I have just been through and completed a full test of the website. Please see my responses to your questions below:<br><br><br>I tested the process on the Mobile version to ensure it was correct, but I found an issue. Whatever I add to the cart, the EOFY coupon offer is already applied before I enter it.<br>The Desktop version is fine. Please see the attached photo.<br>***This is likely because the coupon was already added to your cart on phone. If you use incoginito mode OR remove the coupon code it will function as expected. <br><br>I am unsure whether we should keep the 'Calculate Shipping' section on the 'Add to Cart' page or move it to the 'Proceed to Checkout' page.<br>***Best to have it on the checkout page. The goal is always to get the customer further into the checkout process with the least amount of resistance.<br><br>I proceeded using credit card payment, followed all the steps, and entered my credit card details. However, after completing the payment, the page redirected to another form asking for more details, and the Billing Phone field is marked as required. Please see the attached photo part 1 &amp; part 2.<br>***This is working fine, the phone and email fields must have content in them in order to proceed with paypal. <br><br>Is the wording information below PayPal button is correct, or we should delete it? Is it important?<br>(Your personal data will be used to process your order, support your experience throughout this website, and for other purposes described in our Privacy Policy.<br>Payment accepted via credit card or PayPal.)<br>***This is recommended by PayPal and needs to remain.<br><br>As a buyer, I did not receive a \"Thank you for your order\" message or an email confirmation with the receipt of the payment.<br>***It doesn't appear that you completed your order as I can't see the order in the backend of the website. <br><br>As a seller, I did not receive an email notification that an order has been placed.<br>***I just did a test order. You should have received a notification to <a href=\"mailto:info@veneyes.com.au\">info@veneyes.com.au</a>. If you need to change which email address this is sent to, you can do that here: <a href=\"https://veneyes.com.au/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&amp;tab=email&amp;section=wc_email_new_order\">https://veneyes.com.au/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wc-settings&amp;tab=email&amp;section=wc_email_new_order</a><br><br>Is it possible to do do the background of (Debit or credit card) button is yellow as normal, not black to make it user friendly.<br>***It's recommended to have these as 2 different colours. This is so the customer knows they are two different actions. If they are the same colour, it will confuse the user.<br><br>I created a \"Thankyou10%off\" coupon for new subscribers. Could you adjust it to give 10% off the cart amount, not the product amount?<br>***It appears that this is how it has been setup. The 10% will be discounted from all products within the cart.<br><br>Can you please verify that the entire journey through PayPal or credit card is working correctly?<br>And ensure that the buyer receives an immediate \"Thank you for your order\" message and an email with a receipt of the order details.<br>***Yes, I have just completed a  test, you can see it in the backend here: <br><a href=\"https://veneyes.com.au/wp-admin/post.php?post=4821&amp;action=edit\">https://veneyes.com.au/wp-admin/post.php?post=4821&amp;action=edit</a><br><br>I encourage you to do some further testing, and it's best to do so incognito mode so that you are seeing the website as the customers will. <br>",
