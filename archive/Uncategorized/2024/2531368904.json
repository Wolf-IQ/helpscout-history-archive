            "body": "Hi Erica, <br /><br />1. Website traffic can be broken down into actual users and bots. Without going into too much detail, some 'bots' are good and are used by Google to crawl the pages to ensure they can show users the most relevant results. Other bots can be malicious. Our security is designed to allow the good and block the bad. <br /><br />2. We track the login counts on the website. <a href=\"https://sydneyhearingclinic.com.au/\">https://sydneyhearingclinic.com.au/</a> does not have a user login section so there is no data to track. <br /><br />3. The speed score is typically out of 100. It is worth noting the tools we use to generate that report are focused on security, the performance metrics are indicative. For clients that wish to get detailed data, we use Google Analytics. I have set this up for you now. <br /><br />4. The unit of measure is seconds. Again, the same insight from point 3 should be applied. To get a real indicator of speed and performance, the benchmark or gold standard is the following: <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-sydneyhearingclinic-com-au/j1xgmsaupm?form_factor=mobile\">https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-sydneyhearingclinic-com-au/j1xgmsaupm?form_factor=mobile</a>. This uses Google Page Speed Insights, the very test Google Search will use to determine the performance factors. You can view desktop and mobile view performance.\u00a0<br /><br />5. Monthly reporting. Yes, indeed, you should be receiving this monthly. Your email is the recipient, perhaps it has been going to spam/junk?<br /><br />In terms of performance, this is a broad topic when it comes to a website. I'd need to know more about your goals to then recommend the appropriate support. We tailor the support according to your needs and budget. E.g. some clients only require reports on search visibility and enquiry form submissions. Others opt for more comprehensive support.\u00a0",

What is Login stats and it says insufficient data to make a chart?<br>3. Performance: what is the speed score out of and what is the unit of measurement ie. is it seconds? Same with load time, and what does <em>number</em> <em>of requests</em> mean?<br>4. Load time graph: what is the vertical unit of measurement?<br><br>The lite care plan includes monthly reporting as per the one you sent us, should we be receiving this every month?
