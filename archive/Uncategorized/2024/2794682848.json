The recent 'attack' was able to read this code, before the website was hiding it. This enabled the code to 'check' the box and to proceed with an order. <br><br>We have now manually deleted this option from all products, so the exploit no longer exists. <br><br>We can see a couple of what appear to be 'real' orders have come through since, so it appears the issue now fixed. The checkout page is also back in action. <br><br>We will continue to monitor the orders over the coming days. <br>",
