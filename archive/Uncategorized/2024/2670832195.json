It was not specified that the site would go down if not actioned in a specific date, and we would appreciate it if its explicitly mentioned next time so we can schedule the updates accordingly. Just so we can avoid this issue from arising again.</li>\n<li>If we want to backup the NDIP site (even though its down), can we do that?</li>\n</ul>\n\nKeen to hear back from you, thanks.\n\nRegards,\nAlyssa\n\nCombinate\nsupport@combinate.me\nwww.combinate.me\n1300 247 018\n\n<img width=\"40\" height=\"40\" alt=\"\" class=\"ex-c3\" src=\"https://combinate.zendesk.com/system/photos/900085853166/alyssa.jpeg\"/>\n\n<strong>Alyssa Venturanza</strong> (Combinate Support)\n\n16 Aug 2024, 09:57 GMT+10\n\nThanks, Heath.\n\nLooks to be reflecting now!
