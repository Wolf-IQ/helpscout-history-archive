This should suffice for evidence of how long I have had to put up with the following:<br>\n\u2022 a disturbance to my sleep which has been affecting my health<br>\n\u2022 reminder of a previous dog trauma (attack with injury requiring stitches) - to which I have had counselling<br>\n\u2022 feeling like I am a prisoner in my own apartment as she has occasionally had her dog off the leash in the common area and have been unable to leave my apartment<br>\n\u2022 In June I was harassed by this person as I was trying to walk around her dog (the dog was on a leash), in the common area and she yelled ' What's wrong with you do you have a mental health problem, it' s just a dog barking\". I was totally silent and did not communicate with her and a neighbour came out of his house, witnessing me in tears and consoled me.<br>\n<br>\nI love where I live and am appreciative of everything The Womens Housing Company has been able to help me with and do not want to be rehoused because of another persons nuisance dog. Please let me know what we can do about this situation<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nShe is in breach of the Womens Housing Pet form in the following points below that she would have had to sign.<br>\n<br>\n\u2022 Be responsible for ensuring that pet/s do not create a nuisance to neighbours.<br>\n\u2022 Be responsible for the cost of any damage to the property and/or any issues that may arise from keeping pet/s at the property.<br>\n<br>\nI have emailed Libby a copy of the barking dog diary that Mosman Council requested. I am aware of at least another neighb our who is also submitting a diary to the council.<br>\nPlease let me know what can be done about this.
