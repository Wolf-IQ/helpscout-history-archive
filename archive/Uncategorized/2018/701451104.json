            "body": "Hi Jamie,\u00a0<br /><br />This is a two-fold response.\u00a0<br /><br />Firstly, yes, it's good for images to be indexed. The more you can dictate and filter to the search engines the better. It demonstrates a well rounded representation of information. That being said, what we send them needs to be the best it can be and also respect the user experience (which should always be paramount).\u00a0<br /><br />This leads to the second part of the response, what should we do in this scenario? The link below is not actually to the image, but to the attachment page that can be created when the file is originally uploaded. In this example, the actual image is\u00a0<a href=\"https://visitlatitude25.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my_creative_time_01.jpg\">https://visitlatitude25.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/my_creative_time_01.jpg</a>. The attachment page uses the file name (minus the extension such as .jpg) to create a unique URL. So if your images are named in a meaningful semantic way, this is less of a problem. However, consider that you may create a blog article with 3 images. The site has now created a blog url + 3 image attachment urls. This is not ideal as:<br /><ol><li>The user may land on the attachment page instead of the blog post page.</li><li>Once they land on this attachment page they have little to no context and will leave quickly. This increases bounce rates, reduces dwell time and gives indicators to Google that you are serving less helpful content.\u00a0</li><li>The attachment pages may outrank the actually blog posts, push them down in the search results pages.</li></ol>So with all this being said, the best approach:\u00a0<br /><br /><ol><li>Make sure the images are named in a meaningful way, have ALT text and title tags (at a minimum) FYI there are currently 85/233 images on the site that don't have ALT text.</li><li>301 Redirect the attachment pages that exist to the original blog post/page to show to the search engines the most important and relevant content to index. (All in One SEO has a setting for this: https://semperplugins.com/documentation/all-in-one-seo-pack-advanced-settings/#redirect-attachments-to-post-parent).</li><li>Submit an image sitemap to Google in case some are hidden or not easily accessible by the crawls.\u00a0</li></ol><br />Hope that helps? Let me know if you need any more information. We can certainly sort out item 2 above quickly for you... whether or not you want to go through the process of renaming existing images is another thing, however the title and alt text should be fixed up. It's not a huge ranking factor, but with SEO it's the sum of many parts that gets the edge.\u00a0",
