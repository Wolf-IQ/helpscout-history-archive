You can test the site by modifying your local hosts file. Here's our tutorial: <a href=\"https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/preview/\" target=\"_blank\">https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/preview/</a></p>\n<p>You can use these lines:</p>\n<p>35.228.55.150 finland.wpperk.com</p>\n<p>35.228.55.150 <a href=\"http://www.finland.wpperk.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.finland.wpperk.com</a></p>\n<p>If you can open this link, you are browsing finland.wpperk.com from our Google Cloud environment: <a href=\"http://finland.wpperk.com/googlecloud.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://finland.wpperk.com/googlecloud.html</a></p>\n<p>The site has been switched to PHP 7.2 and I've uploaded our Kinsta Cache plugin. You can clear our server side caching from the Tools tab inside the MyKinsta Dashboard for the site, or from within the WordPress Dashboard on the Kinsta Cache page.</p>\n<p>Please test everything and let us know if you need any help. </p>\n<p>If you think your site is ready, please point your domain's A record to <b>35.228.55.150</b> . (If your site is behind Cloudflare you have to update the A record there). Also, please remove the AAAA record, if you have one.</p>\n<p>We have a small list of plugins that are disallowed on our infrastructure, please take a look at it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/disallowed-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/disallowed-plugins/</a></p>\n<p>I've moved some unnecessary files and disallowed plugins to the 'old' folder located within the main ~/public directory.</p>\n<p>I've also made a post-migration backup on our server in case you need to restore the site from a clean backup that was made immediately after the migration was completed and tested working properly. You can find that backup located in your MyKinsta panel &gt;&gt; Sites Tab &gt;&gt; Manage the site you are working on &gt;&gt; Backups tab &gt;&gt; Manual Tab. Please note this backup will only be available for 14 days in case you need it.</p>\n<p>Please check the site and change the DNS as soon as you can. If you update anything on the old server (before making the DNS change), the changes will be lost.</p>\n<p>If you have any further questions regarding this migration feel free to let me know, otherwise good luck with your site! </p> \n<p>Regarding Let's Encrypt, the SSL will need to be issued after you have pointed your DNS over to us and it has propagated globally. We have a guide below on how you can do that:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/how-to-install-ssl-certificate/\" target=\"_blank\">https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/how-to-install-ssl-certificate/</a></p> \n<p> On Thu, Aug 23, 2018 at 03:36 PM, \"Dan G.\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:dan.g@kinsta.intercom-mail.com\" target=\"_blank\">dan.g@kinsta.intercom-mail.com</a>&gt; wrote: <br> </p> \n<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>I am starting on the migration process now.
