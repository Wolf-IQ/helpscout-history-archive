Webhooks are used to notify your server about events that happen in your Stripe account, such as a payout completing or an invoice being created. The failing webhook endpoint is <a href=\"https://proposal.advantagestyling.com.au/?callback=gravityformsstripe\" target=\"_blank\">https://proposal.advantagestyling.com.au/?callback=gravityformsstripe</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>You or someone on your team has added that endpoint in your Stripe webhook settings, which you can view and edit here: <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks\" target=\"_blank\">https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Please note that in most cases a failing webhook does not impact your charges or payouts. However, if you use subscriptions we rely on your webhook endpoint to notify you of new invoices. These invoices may be delayed for up to three days if your webhook is unable to successfully receive them.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>We\u2019ve attempted to notify the endpoint 50 times since May 29, 2018 at 01:35AM. If this endpoint is important to your application, please try and fix the issue. If you do not need the webhook endpoint you can delete it from your Stripe webhook settings. We will stop sending notifications to your webhook by June 10, 2018. This email is the last time we'll reach out to you before disabling the webhook.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>One recent call to your endpoint returned an HTTP status code 400, However, our webhook systems only treats a webhook as successful if we get back a status code between 200 and 299. You can view the event for this failed notification here: <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events/evt_1CaDMNHu3t6TkyvAb6DNLTIg\" target=\"_blank\">https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events/evt_1CaDMNHu3t6TkyvAb6DNLTIg</a>. To acknowledge receipt of a webhook, your endpoint should return a 2xx HTTP status code.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>For more in depth information about how to use webhooks, we recommend taking a look at our documentation: <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks\" target=\"_blank\">https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks</a>.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Yours,</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>The Stripe team<br></p>",
