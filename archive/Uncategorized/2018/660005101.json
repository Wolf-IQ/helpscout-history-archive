The privacy policy page gives an error message</b>. <a href=\"https://shellshockedmedia.com/privacy-policy__trashed/\" target=\"_blank\">https://shellshockedmedia.com/privacy-policy__trashed/</a> Can you please fix this? Is there a standard privacy policy?</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><b>2. Chapter 7 Challenge \u2013 Just do it - the transcript is missing</b></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Please add</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><strong>CHALLENGE</strong></p> \n<p>You\u2019ve probably already put two and two together and figured out that my challenge for you this chapter is to jump in front of the camera.</p> \n<p>If this is completely new to you, then start with something small like a live video on Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook that doesn\u2019t need any editing.</p> \n<p>If you\u2019re a little more game, why not script and film a video and send it to family or friends for feedback?</p> \n<p>But please, when you\u2019re watching yourself back, be critical but don\u2019t pick yourself apart.</p> \n<p>The only way to make engaging, really great videos, is to start off making some not-so-great ones.</p> \n<p>The more you make, the more comfortable you\u2019ll become on screen.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><b>3. Chapter 8 </b><b>Pep talk \u2013 You\u2019ve got this! </b><b>transcript is missing \u2013 please add</b></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><b> </b></p> \n<p> Congratulations! You\u2019ve finished my media and presentation course! Yay you! So, I just wanted to recap some of the lessons for you. Remember you can go back and re-do the chapters at any time. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>I strongly advise you do the voice lessons and facial warm ups every single time before you present to camera or do a media interview. It\u2019s like getting on your game face. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>And listen to my free MP3 of the Nerve Busting Breathing Exercise. Just press play and I\u2019ll guide you through the exercise to help calm your nerves. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Check out your pics of presenting outfits so you remember what to wear. Dress to suit the image you want to project. And remember bright block colours work best. You want to pop on screen.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Remember never say no to make up, and that includes the fellas, because studio lights can make you look like the walking dead </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Spend some time working out your key messages. The basics of every interview comes down to Who What Where When Why How.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Don\u2019t write it out in full and memorise it. Reduce each key message to three dot points. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Keep in mind great story telling involves sharing anecdotes. Tell a story, paint pictures with your words and people will remember your message.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Never forget my life motto - the 5Ps \u2013 Prior Preparation Prevents Piss-poor Performance. If you\u2019ve done the hard work and prepared properly you will perform well. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Be aware of your body language. You need to be in control of everything from your facial expressions to your gestures because the things we don't say, can still say so much. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Keep eye contact, if you look away you look untrustworthy. Use that trick I taught you about looking between the eyebrows. It really works and no-one will ever know. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Know the show you are going to appear on and the audience. Set the TV to record the shows you may appear on so you know their presenters and their style.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>NEVER, ever, EVER say \u201cNo Comment\u201d. If you are dealing with tricky or negative questions just answer honestly and as positively as possible.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Prepare for some negative feedback. Time you get some thick skin.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>If you are presenting straight to camera look <i>through </i>the lens, not <i>at</i>the lens, as it helps you connect with people watching.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>It\u2019s also important to realise people want you to succeed.</p> \n<p><b></b></p> \n<p>Your audiencewants you to be interesting, stimulating, informative and entertaining. They\u2019re rooting for you. They\u2019re not there hoping you do a crap job in telling your story.</p> \n<p><b></b></p> \n<p>And finally\u2026 Enjoyit. Remember your WHY? You\u2019ve worked hard to get to where you are and you wanted to get this exposure. Remember your initial passion and try to have fun. After all, if you\u2019re having fun people will enjoy watching you. </p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p>Now because you have finished this course you are now part of the alumni and I\u2019ve got some awesome offers for you.</p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p>If you would like to top up this course with some one-on-one training with me you\u2019ll get it at a discount. </p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p>Plus, if you are not based in Sydney I am also available for Skype consultations. Where we can choose to work on your key messages to make sure they are exactly right. Or you can send me iPhone clips of your presenting and I will assess them over Skype and suggest ways you can improve.</p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p>I\u2019ll also have some add-on courses coming soon including: </p> \n<p>- How to be a great MC</p> \n<p>- Presenting the perfect key note speech</p> \n<p>- How to moderate a panel</p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p>So, watch your inbox for new tips and tricks. Or email me via the contact page if want some more information. I\u2019m Shelly Horton and it\u2019s been a pleasure teaching you. I can\u2019t wait to see you shine on camera.</p> \n<p><br></p> \n<p>Shelly Horton</p> \n<p>0404 868 463</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.shellshockedmedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">shellshockedmedia.com</a></p> \n<p>&lt;sigimg1.jpeg&gt;</p>\n<p></p> \n<br>",
