I will highlight that different sections of the form will appear based on what you select for the \"Type of client\" question. E.g. If you select High School Aged, you will only see the options for that type of patient. So to test you need to select the different age groups. Hope that makes sense? I have also restyled the form to be cleaner and easier to follow as it's a big one : )<br /><br /><a href=\"https://hdspeechtherapy.com.au/questionnaire/\">https://hdspeechtherapy.com.au/questionnaire/</a> <br /><br />Regarding the Christmas message and calendar (awesome idea by the way!) I have put it at the top of the site on every page, as I think it warrants being in a nice obvious position. It may be missed further down the site and only on the home page.
