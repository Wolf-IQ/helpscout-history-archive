I don't want an additional heading across the top, and alternatively think it should perhaps be an option under FAQs - \"Chalky Teeth\" and \"Other topics\".<br>&gt; I also want to see how to incorporate the \"We fight chalky teeth\" icon on the home page. Maybe we can fiddle around with the bottom half of the page to fit it in somewhere.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I will also fiddle with the wording of the satellite page. At the moment it sounds quite awkward.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hope you have been well.<br>&gt; Let me know your thoughts.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Warm regards<br>&gt; Caroline<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &lt;Caroline Chung SPD mock_a.pdf&gt;&lt;Caroline Chung SPD mock_a.pptx&gt;",
