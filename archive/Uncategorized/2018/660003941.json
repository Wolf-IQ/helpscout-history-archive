Our question is, how long do you think it would take until you reached the 100 installs? If it's a matter of a few days, 1-2 weeks then we'd recommend sticking to your E3 plan but if it might take one or several months, then you could downgrade, we would manually add the extra installs to your account and you'll only need to upgrade once you've reached 100 installs.<br><br>Would that work for you?<br><br>Kind regards, <br>Fatima </p>\n<p>--</p>\n<a href=\"https://static.intercomassets.com/avatars/1745898/square_128/ejnIMG_6329-1516012318.JPG?1516012318\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.intercomassets.com/avatars/1745898/square_128/ejnIMG_6329-1516012318.JPG?1516012318</a>\n<strong>Fatima</strong> from Kinsta \n<p> On Wed, Aug 8, 2018 at 08:06 PM, \"Operator\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:operator@kinsta.intercom-mail.com\" target=\"_blank\">operator@kinsta.intercom-mail.com</a>&gt; wrote: <br> </p>\n<p>Help Fatima understand how they\u2019re doing:</p>\n<p> Rate your conversation </p>\n<a href=\"https://app.intercom.io/ratings?token=9ecfdb64-de97-4f11-bd48-3971c8c470ba&amp;rating_index=1\" target=\"_blank\"> https://static.intercom-mail.com/assets/ratings/rating-1-60x60-at-2x-cc6116cc4574ac8e283a60089d2361e96011d816a2db7166bd9889e384d5c568.png </a>\n<a href=\"https://app.intercom.io/ratings?token=9ecfdb64-de97-4f11-bd48-3971c8c470ba&amp;rating_index=2\" target=\"_blank\"> https://static.intercom-mail.com/assets/ratings/rating-2-60x60-at-2x-c5ee794dd37323f8c376be7ecae997254c060663be96cdc9b51af65702744b55.png </a>\n<a href=\"https://app.intercom.io/ratings?token=9ecfdb64-de97-4f11-bd48-3971c8c470ba&amp;rating_index=3\" target=\"_blank\"> https://static.intercom-mail.com/assets/ratings/rating-3-60x60-at-2x-4ca083c0a210db4fc8ad18d8c491ce4e74da65117b9bd6d534f697912a5b9005.png </a>\n<a href=\"https://app.intercom.io/ratings?token=9ecfdb64-de97-4f11-bd48-3971c8c470ba&amp;rating_index=4\" target=\"_blank\"> https://static.intercom-mail.com/assets/ratings/rating-4-60x60-at-2x-96270f90826bff485ba88c83f0a2294224466d1f721872bc23c879ddd2312883.png </a>\n<a href=\"https://app.intercom.io/ratings?token=9ecfdb64-de97-4f11-bd48-3971c8c470ba&amp;rating_index=5\" target=\"_blank\"> https://static.intercom-mail.com/assets/ratings/rating-5-60x60-at-2x-e182d0473f839f9bde196b2b1fdd50fef6c8179e75e09558bcbf29ce3d94f51e.png </a>\n<p> On Wed, Aug 8, 2018 at 07:32 PM, \"Fatima Paczkan\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:fatima.paczkan@kinsta.intercom-mail.com\" target=\"_blank\">fatima.paczkan@kinsta.intercom-mail.com</a>&gt; wrote: <br> </p>\n<p>Hi there, </p>\n<p>Pellumb asked me to jump in on the conversation since Dora's and I work closely together. <br>No worries, Dora is still with us however she's on a maternity leave at the moment enjoying some quality time with her family.
