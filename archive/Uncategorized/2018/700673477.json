            "body": "Hey Heath,<br><br>Great job on the DBL Events website! It's looking good.<br><br>There are just a few changes we would like to make:<br>In the 'here's some recent work' section instead of the heading saying 'What we do' could we change it to 'What we did'<br>The check list underneath that only seems to load when you scroll down on the page, could we have that loaded already on the page?<br>We would like to make all photos a bit sharper and less blurry<br>There is a photo in the 'Annual National Sales and Marketing Conference' that has a date on the right bottom corner, could you please remove that and add another photo from the Parmalat photo folders that Michael shared with you. Also add IMG_4383.jpg and IMG_1199.jpg to that section.<br>In the 'Australia and NZ Sales Conference section, could you please remove the AstraZeneca company logos that are shown in the photos<br>We haven't received a quote from NAB so could you remove the current quote from that section and redesign the page without a quote?<br>Lastly, could you remove the stock photos from the Annual Leadership Conference and add the photos that are in the AECOM folder in the photo file that Michael shared with you.<br>If you have any questions about the changes feel free to give me a call on the number below.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Mickayla Moffett<br>m 0497288945<br>e mickayla@deepbluelearning.com.au &lt;mailto:mickayla@deepbluelearning.com.au&gt;<br>www.deepbluelearning.com.au &lt;http://www.deepbluelearning.com.au/&gt;",
