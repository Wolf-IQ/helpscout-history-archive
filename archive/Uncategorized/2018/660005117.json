She will be back though in a few months! :) Until then and afterwards as well, I'm very happy to help you if needed.</p>\n<p>If you don't mind, it would be a big help if you could send that part of the conversation with Dora. It might be a faster process than me going through some previous conversations. In case this was a set thing, I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem however I would like to run that by our finance team again if that's okay. </p>\n<p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>\n<p>Best regards, <br>Fatima </p> \n<p>--</p> \n<a href=\"https://static.intercomassets.com/avatars/1745898/square_128/ejnIMG_6329-1516012318.JPG?1516012318\" target=\"_blank\">https://static.intercomassets.com/avatars/1745898/square_128/ejnIMG_6329-1516012318.JPG?1516012318</a> \n<strong>Fatima</strong> from Kinsta \n<p> On Wed, Aug 8, 2018 at 05:10 PM, \"WP Perk Support Team\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:support@wpperk.com\" target=\"_blank\">support@wpperk.com</a>&gt; wrote: <br> </p> \n<p>cool thanks!</p> \n<p> On Wed, Aug 8, 2018 at 05:09 PM, \"Pellumb Dalipi\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:pellumb.dalipi@kinsta.intercom-mail.com\" target=\"_blank\">pellumb.dalipi@kinsta.intercom-mail.com</a>&gt; wrote: <br> </p> \n<p>If we should need more information, my colleague will definitely get back to you about that.</p> \n<p> On Wed, Aug 8, 2018 at 05:07 PM, \"WP Perk Support Team\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:support@wpperk.com\" target=\"_blank\">support@wpperk.com</a>&gt; wrote: <br> </p> \n<p>Awesome thanks Pellumb.
