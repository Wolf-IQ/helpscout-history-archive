Rev Slider stores these as absolute URLs and not necessarily in the cleanest way (they have hash values etc). This means that during the migration process, our scripts to rewrite the live URL with the staging URL won't catch them all.\u00a0<br /><br />This is not a problem for us though as the site will be eventually running on the live URL and the images are definitely ready to go on our server. Prior to the DNS updates being made, for go live, we replace all staging URLs with the live ones anyway.\u00a0<br /><br />If you would like, we can let you check the site by updating your local hosts files to point the domain name to our server. You can then have the comfort that the image references, links etc are all functional as the live site will be by passed. Let me know if you would like to test the site this way?\u00a0<br /><br />Finally, let us know when you are ready for us to live the site. We like to do at around 9 or 10pm as traffic drops off around this time. There will be no downtime, but the site will run on our servers for up to the first 10mins on http whilst we generate and get the SSL certs validated.\u00a0<br />",
