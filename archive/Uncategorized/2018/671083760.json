At the moment the articles are created in Ready to Read backend and saved as drafts, once they are approved we will publish them and link with the mailchimp newsletter.<br><br>Would it be possible if you could login into Ready to Read website and go to the \u201cPost\u201d section, there you will be able to see the draft articles (first 6 in the list). To visualise them just click \u201cPreview\u201d inside each article.<br><br>Regarding the stretched images when you forward the test mailchimp newsletter, we believe it\u2019s because you are using Outlook and sometimes it\u2019s just what it does\u2026it\u2019s Outlook :) Once we send the edm to everyone, it will be fine, it\u2019s just when it\u2019s forwarded.<br><br>Please let us know if you need to change anything.<br><br>Thanks.<br>JOAO HENRIQUES<br>SENIOR DESIGNER - WOLFIQ.COM.AU &lt;https://wolfiq.com.au/&gt;<br>E. joao@wolfiq.com.au  &lt;mailto:joao@wolfiq.com.au&gt;  |  P. 1300 072 134  |  M. 0413 107 875<br><br><br><br><br>&gt; On 20 Sep 2018, at 5:33 pm, Michelle Mowbray &lt;michelle@readytoread.com.au &lt;mailto:michelle@readytoread.com.au&gt;&gt; wrote:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Hi Joao<br>&gt; I\u2019d like to update these summaries please \u2013 will get revised copy to you.
