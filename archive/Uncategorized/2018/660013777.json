I\u2019ll definitely be condensing the physio article. I\u2019ll also use the article we placed on our website, one more compelling article about the importance of early literacy (around 600 words) and I\u2019m waiting on two others \u2013 one about child care and one about swimming. Do you think four pages would be sufficient for the first edition? I anticipate that the front page would also be content-rich.</p>\n<p>With regards to speaking with your contacts below, we would certainly like to source content from them for the second edition rather than the first edition given timing and space; but for this first edition do you think ENT Care and the Dentistry place would be interested in contributing something very short? For dentistry it could be \u20185 tips for sending your child to school with top oral health\u2019; and for ENT it could be a definition to de-mystify a concept, e.g. \u2018What is a grommet?\u2019</p>\n<p>Below is a snapshot of how we\u2019re communicating the concept so you have talking points. I\u2019m also highlighting to everyone that we need the content by next week so we can edit, design and print in time for 18 April pop-up library!</p>\n<p><i>We</i><i>\u2019re bringing together content for our new publication, Bridge to School, which will be sent as an e-blast to our own mailing lists, as well as printed and distributed via child care centres, our own locations across Sydney and at our pop-up children</i><i>\u2019s libraries (the next two are planned for the Entertainment Quarter in Moore Park mid-April and the Pregnancy, Babies and Children</i><i>\u2019s Expo in May).</i></p>\n<p><i>The first edition will include content from a variety of specialty areas including literacy, speech pathology, physiotherapy, education and child care, to give parents the information they need to know in order to help their children prepare for school. Future editions will include content from allied health professionals. </i></p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Michelle</p>\n<p><b>From:</b> Heath Maguire - Wolf IQ [<a href=\"mailto:heath@wolfiq.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">mailto:heath@wolfiq.com.au</a>] <br><b>Sent:</b> Tuesday, March 20, 2018 6:22 PM<br><b>To:</b> Michelle Mowbray &lt;<a href=\"mailto:michelle@readytoread.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">michelle@readytoread.com.au</a>&gt;<br><b>Cc:</b> David Mowbray &lt;<a href=\"mailto:david@readytoread.com.au\" target=\"_blank\">david@readytoread.com.au</a>&gt;<br><b>Subject:</b> Re: Bridge to School</p>\n<p>Great thanks Michelle, </p>\n<p>Can you please send them through so that when we do the mock up we can gauge the length etc? </p>\n<p>Also, regarding the pricing for these, we will do the First Edition (how cool does that sound!) for $44/page.
