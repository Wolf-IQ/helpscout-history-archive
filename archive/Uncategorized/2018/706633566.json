The good news is that we have created a better UX experience. We did this by putting the video and copy side-by-side. The benefits are two fold, firstly it makes the video more obvious and 'clickable', we have also enhanced the video icon in normal and hover state. Secondly, it makes the text easier to read and is more accessible friendly from a colour contrast ratio. Let me know if this is ok with you? If not, we can custom code this module to look like the old style.<br />Link:\u00a0<a href=\"https://elsis.wpperk.com/\">https://elsis.wpperk.com/</a>\u00a0<br /><br /><strong>Item 2 - Form warning/message</strong><br />Yes, you are correct, this is just because the form is expecting to load on your live domain. Once we go live with this version of the site, the error message will disappear.<br /><br /><strong>Item 3 - Code on accommodation page<br /></strong>Confirming we have removed this. It looks like there used to be a gallery there.\u00a0<br />Link:\u00a0<a href=\"https://elsis.wpperk.com/accommodation/\">https://elsis.wpperk.com/accommodation/</a>",

(this means more security and more speed).<br>Given the feedback that the sites were previously hacked, we also ran it through 9 security trusts and checked all of the files for malware and thankfully it passed all of the tests.<br>Reduced database bloat by 3MB<br><br>So, next step is to review the site, have a good click through and make sure everything is as you would expect.

As there may be another IP block going on.<br><br>Alternatively, do you have access to any website backups? Amir previously mentioned they are saving to DropBox (from memory). If you can get us a recent backup we can work from there. There may even be a backup in the GoDaddy account?
