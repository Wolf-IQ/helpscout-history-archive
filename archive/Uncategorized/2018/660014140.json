Olark is committed to helping you be GDPR compliant by May 24, 2018. We are working hard with our legal and engineering teams to ensure to the extent Olark directly collects EU personal data it is in compliance with the GDPR.</p>\n<p>We are fully compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss \u2013 U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>What is GDPR?</strong></p>\n<p>The (GDPR) is the new European Union (EU) data privacy law that greatly strengthens data privacy protections for EU residents. It basically gives EU residents more control over how organizations collect, process, store, and share their personal data online.</p>\n<p>The GDPR also imposes new obligations on all organizations that process EU personal data regardless where the organization is located. \u201cPersonal data\u201d is a term that the GDPR broadly defines, but in general it can be thought of as any data that can personally identify an individual. The GDPR is territorial - meaning the GDPR applies to any organization that controls and processes EU personal data, regardless of where the organization may be located.</p>\n<p>We are taking the GDPR very seriously since failing to comply with the GDPR is costly \u2013 a fine of the greater of 4% of global revenue or 20 million euros can be imposed against an organization is relation to certain GDPR violations.</p>\n<p><strong>What does GDPR mean for Olark customers?</strong></p>\n<p>By using Olark\u2019s services your organization likely collects personal data - such as by using a pre-chat survey form, custom fields or by receiving a chat transcript. If you collect personal data from EU residents (\u201cdata subjects\u201d under the GDPR), then you are likely subject to the GDPR.</p>\n<p>To best understand your role and Olark\u2019s role under the GDPR, it\u2019s critical to understand three key terms as they relate to our services: data subjects, data controllers, and data processors. As the party deciding the purposes for which you need to collect data subject data and how to collect it, Olark\u2019s customers are the data controllers. The data subjects are your customers residing in the EU. Olark is a processor because we process data on your behalf and on your instructions. </p>\n<p>Notice: Under the GDPR, organizations are required to provide notice to data subjects whenever they collect personal data from the data subject. In the notice, organizations must identify the lawful basis for processing the personal data (see<a href=\"https://hello.olark.com/e1t/c/*N4vpZWjNnD9JW7X1jPW3D-mSY0/*VFWlQ242r0q7W6vYnJp3BMFsB0/5/f18dQhb0S5fs8XJ93YW7FxDQZ2qwv1SW2sSdCQ2MDHTkMf5vKsXD6prW7cmS1s8x2ncZW6R9vXm96f589W98kKZm6QPnp2W1d4t2F5mNLNvW7bqTzM7vp5QyW4m-3Rx1ZJ0nXW4DqHqz6dgmw3W4yv2r03LmS2WW2PQtQd3M3KvXW6dL3pb49WVtrW3VVg3w3y8j_4W6G2lbz7NMdQNV4cNXy75WRHJW55cB9k17SvSTW1YbCd777M47MW2M0B3H8tJGmPW72HQJ_1MQ9LxN5L3WBbMlR2GW1bK9pX3nwn-lW2LPCHc8j5SDSW782Hdn6VZ5RCW4H9CK36KbPWZW3w8gwY52Q2-pW5q1_f246K31XW32P56b5gSHY5W6H5W1X2cKpZKVVR6H24q1BkhN4SwHy5pCq6zW12QnYK30TY-5N5mZ4YkWDM01W798HBG9j2S5XN9c3283Xm-wxW6pNjPV8J7KmJW56ncjw2SW3-jW2D4BKZ73Q0vRV1-MZ180stD7102\" target=\"_blank\"> Article 6</a> of the GDPR). Data controllers must make that determination.</p>\n<p>Individual Rights: Under the GDPR, EU data subjects have the right to access the personal data a company is processing on them; to restrict the processing; to correct incomplete or inaccurate personal data; to have their personal data deleted; and to object to their data being used for certain purposes.</p>\n<p>Retention: Under the GDPR, EU personal data should not be kept any \u201cno longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.\u201d It is the responsibility of the data controller to determine the appropriate time period for which to retain EU personal data, and convey those periods to the data processor. </p>\n<p><strong>What is Olark doing about GDPR?</strong></p>\n<p>We are working closely with our legal team to make sure Olark is compliant by the deadline, and that you, as our customer, have the tools you need to be GDPR compliant when collecting data via Olark.</p>\n<p>Olark already has tools and processes in place to address deletion and correction requests.</p>\n<p>We will be working with our customers (and our vendors) to put GDPR compliant Data Processing Agreements in place prior to May 25, 2018.
