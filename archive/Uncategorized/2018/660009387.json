For those ones, we will probably do ourselves to avoid those complications. For the ones that you guys migrate a lot of our clients either don't have or use their backend admin access either. So it will be easy to enforce a content freeze of sorts. </p> \n<p> On Thu, May 31, 2018 at 10:46 AM, \"James Fraser\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:james.fraser@kinsta.intercom-mail.com\" target=\"_blank\">james.fraser@kinsta.intercom-mail.com</a>&gt; wrote: <br> </p> \n<p>Understood completely. :D</p>\n<p>Are they e-commerce sites, or otherwise user-driven?

I have around 50-60 sites currently hosted on WPEngine. I'm keen to move them over to you guys at some point as I'm loving the servers and service you provide. So the question: If I upgrade our account to allow for the extra site and pay for you to migrate them all, would I need to fill out a migration request for each site or would I simply be able to grant you access to our WPEngine portal? Obviously the later is my preferred as it will save me a heap of time. Thanks in advance! </p>",
