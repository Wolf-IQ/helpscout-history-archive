I have been feeling this loosen over the last 3 weeks and made an appointment to have this looked at.</p>\n<p>30 minutes before my appointment I was notified that my dentist was sick and I had to push this out another week, there was no other soloution offered to me. I have 2 young children and had organised this appointment around them so that I could attend as this is extremely difficult to bring them in with me for everyone. I then couldnt make the following appointment as my husbund was late from work. I rescheduled one more time to this afternoon at 430 and this was a push to even get this appointment before the christmas break. I was pulling up in the car park when a very rude lady from recpetion called me and advised it was too late as i was 10 minutes late! On my count it was 6 minutes and I tried to explain I had been caught in traffic! I was told i could have it looked at but no treatment would be offered however i could sense the reluctuntess in her voice. My family and I have been loyal customers of DB dental rockingham for nearly 10 years and have always been very happy and reffered others to the clinic . However now I am left with a wobbly false tooth that will come away any day now and no possibility of an appointment before the end of the year.<br>\nOn each and every occasion I have visited this clinic i have been made to wait on average at least 20 - 30 minutes and sometimes nearly an hour.<br>\nSo be turned away today as I was 6 minutes late is absoloutely disgusting. The level of customer service is plain wrong. </p>\n<p>Needles to say I will be looking for a new dental clinic asap!<br>\nJulie Arnaud</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
