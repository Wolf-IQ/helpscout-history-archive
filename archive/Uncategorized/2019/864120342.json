You can activate these by putting a latitude and longitude value, as well as the country in the backend for the event(s) in question and then publish\u00a0them.<strong><br /><br />2. Find an event dropdown search\u00a0<br /><br /></strong>The reason why some countries are not showing is because we only load the countries that have events running in them. The reason why some countries are showing in other languages is due to the way the system works, it uses the country name, in the users language to categorise the events. Hence why may see different spelling for the same country. If you want to fix these, you could manually change the country name to the english language version in the backend of the website. Just head to the event in question and click edit.<br /><br /><strong>3.\u00a0List of Events<br /></strong><br />The members events are currently showing in both the lists of evetns and in the scroll icons above. Maybe change the number of events you are viewing in the table from 10 to 100 to find and cross check more easily.\u00a0<br /><br /><strong>4.\u00a0Inaccessible Buttons</strong><br /><br />Sure, we have changed this to left and right navigation arrows that are larger and more accessible.\u00a0<br /><strong></strong><br />",

It is essential to us that this happens as soon as possible as it is against our organizational policy for a healthcare company to upload more than one WMSD event. I have been unable to delete this on the backend for some reason as it is not showing up in any search entries.<br><br>\nIn addition to the Wall-IO social wall request included in the email below, the following issues also need fixing on the events map.<br><br><p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Entries not showing up</p>\nIt seems like we have far more entries at the backend of the website than are showing on the actual map. Please could you help us make sure that this is not the case. It would be great if you could also point out an easy way for me to cross-reference these data sets to make sure this is not happening.<br><br><p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">'Find an Event' drop down search</p>\nThe  drop down search for the find an event page does not include all countries around the world (ie, finland, Nigeria, Iran etc). In addition, countries like Spain and Mexico are spelt in Spanish unlike the rest of the options.<br><br><p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">List of Events</p>\nCan we include entries from our members in the large 'list of events' rather than just on the scroll icons above. Many of our members have been confused when their event has not appeared in the list below.<br><br><p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Inaccessible Buttons</p>\nIs there a way that we can make these buttons bigger so that users can find it easier to browse through member events? Our users with MS may have sight issues or limited mobility, so this function is inaccessible for them.<br><br><br><img width=\"576\" height=\"115\" src=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/a587ef2fd17940f94708f6804435ce5922c2beb9/3eda1189065cf457ec66e023f47ecda0f5cedad7/image003.jpg\" alt=\"https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/inline/87172/a587ef2fd17940f94708f6804435ce5922c2beb9/3eda1189065cf457ec66e023f47ecda0f5cedad7/image003.jpg\" /><br><br>\nLet me know if you have any questions about any of the above.
