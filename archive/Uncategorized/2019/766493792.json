We have been working on the site to get a few performance gains.\u00a0<br /><br />The PageSpeed score, in particular for mobile has risen from around 14 to 42, here is a link:\u00a0https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsargoodoncollaroy.com%2F&amp;tab=mobile\u00a0<br /><br />I will point out that although the PageSpeed tool implies that this score is the 'speed' of your website, it's actually a series of tests that are run to determine the theoretical performance of the website. The algorithm they use is questionable as it bases the performance on using an older model Motorola device with a slow 3G connection. This scenario is highly unlikely in our local market. It should be used a reference point for potential improvements, but not the 'be-all-and-end-all' if that makes sense? There are a lot of instances that if you try to score closer to 100/100 the net result is ironically a slower website.\u00a0<br /><br />A more realistic tool that is an industry standard to measure a sites performance in Australia is Pingdom. These test the site in a more real-world scenario. As long as the site is loading in under 3secs from Pingdom, you are fine. In its ranking algorithm Google uses true speed versus the PageSpeed score if that makes sense.\u00a0<br /><br />With Pingdom the site is loading in around 2 - 2.5 secs, which is great for this type of website. Hope this clarifies and let me know if you need any more info. Here is the link:\u00a0https://tools.pingdom.com/#5a31ac4d83800000\u00a0<br />",

I agreed with them to do back end work and not to change any copy however unfortunately there was a change of staff and content was changed in line with key word research as we discovered and you fixed yesterday.<br><br>Social Garden has identified other areas that need attention and I am writing to see if you could assist? Could this work could be incorporated into the monthly support arrangement we have going and spread over whatever time frame is required?<br><br>404 pages identified in attached report.<br><br>Orphaned pages identified need attention. I will share a link to you with details.<br><br>You should check your website performance of Google\u2019s PageSpeed Insights tool to check potential speed and usability issues:<br>https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ &lt;https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/&gt;<br>The mobile speed looks poor and you should ask your developers to review the reasons for this and make improvements where possible.<br><br>Related to the above comment, the Analytics Site Speed report (in Behaviour) shows average load time as over 6 seconds in Australia over the past month, with the home page at 8 seconds, which is not ideal (less than 5 seconds recommended).<br><br>There are also no events tracking in the Analytics reports, which can help collect more information about site usage. I would recommend event tracking is added where possible to track such things as:<br>- clicks on the phone number and email contact links<br>- interactions with the Chat tool<br>- clicks to view the Interactive Tour<br>- submissions of the newsletter signup form<br>- clicks off to your social media pages and any other external websites<br><br>Set up a goal which measures clicks on the phone number and email address?<br><br>Could we set up a goal which measures how many click on the \u201cI acknowledge\u201d button on this page https://sargoodoncollaroy.com/enquire-now/ &lt;https://sargoodoncollaroy.com/enquire-now/&gt;?<br><br>I noted some issues with the site which may be related to the recent page changes, but on this page:<br>https://sargoodoncollaroy.com/overview/specialist-disability-accommodation/ &lt;https://sargoodoncollaroy.com/overview/specialist-disability-accommodation/&gt;<br>there are some strange number strings in the 3 white package panels, plus the \u2018Book This Room\u2019 link go to 404 error pages.<br><br>Thank you Heath.<br><br>Kind regards,<br><br>Trudy.<br><br><br>Trudy McEnearney<br>Business Development and Marketing Manager<br>235 Morrison Road, Ryde NSW 2112<br>D. +61 2 9808 9356 &lt;tel:+61%202%209808%209356&gt;<br>E.
