Frequently however there is little to no pain.<br><br><strong>Is cholesteatoma surgery dangerous?</strong> There are risks with any operation but generally the surgery is considered low risk when performed by a trained otologist.<br><br><strong>Is cholesteatoma serious?</strong> If left unattended the lesion can grow and damage critical structures such as the inner ear (hearing and balance), facial nerve (causing facial weakness) and the brain (causing meningitis or brain abscesses).<br><br><strong>How long does it take to recover from Cholesteatoma surgery?</strong> Recovery varies according to the approach for the surgery and healing factors of the patient, but the following are good guidelines:<br>Keyhole endoscopic approach (usually 1-5 days off work/school and back to swimming in 4-6 weeks),<br>Canal Wall Up Surgery (3-5 days off work/school, swimming 6-8 weeks) and<br>Canal wall down (7-10 days off work/school, swimming 8-12 weeks).<br><br>Also can I get access to the site to change author of the article information please?<br><br>Thanks<br><br>Nirmal",

The single word keywords are always hard to rank for as they are targeted by general information sources providing 'definitions' as well as competitors.\u00a0<br /><br />That being said, there is always room for improvement! If you Google the term 'cholesteatoma' you will see the section under \"People also ask\" (screenshot attached). This gives us clues as to the type of things users are wanting information on when it comes to your search term. If you click read one of these, you will see more appear.\u00a0<br /><br />If you can answer a few of these questions, we can add it to your cholesteatoma page here: <a href=\"https://hillsent.com.au/services/cholesteatoma-dr-nirmal-patel-endoscopic-ear-surgery-sydney/\">https://hillsent.com.au/services/cholesteatoma-dr-nirmal-patel-endoscopic-ear-surgery-sydney/</a> to build a well structured page that represents the type of information users are looking for when searching this term.\u00a0<br /><br />The more you can answer the better. Google also loves this type of 'evergreen' content as they will see you are coming back and adding to it over time. This shows that not only is the current information still relevant, but that you are also maintaining and building on this solid base.\u00a0<br /><br />Feel free to send through the extra content and we will load it up for you.",
