Perhaps sacrifice the bottom part of the photo in the responsiveness.<br>- The practices near me button should go to NDC's homepage and not DBD's.<br>- We've updated testimonials. Please see document attached, I have attributed two of the testimonials that were missing a name before (one DA and one hygienist) to new people.<br>- Gordon's quote needs to say National Dental Care / DB Dental. https://cbo.d.pr/Wsu461<br>- Gordon's quote should say NDC Clinical Advisory Committee - we recently changed the name. https://cbo.d.pr/1PFUC1<br>- Remove this testimony: https://cbo.d.pr/yc3GF3. The consultant has left the business.<br><br><br>DBD Career Page:<br>- We'll provide another photo which will show the DBD team. Please also note on the responsiveness as mentioned above.<br>- Please separate 4 from TEETH. So it appears as 1300 4 TEETH across website wide.<br>- Under why work with us and the education and training icon, change the copy to say DB Dental (https://cbo.d.pr/wBjotG)<br>- The OUR ROLES images should be the DB Dental ones I sent you through the other day - see attached again with DB testimonials page. I'm still awaiting a dentist one. (I've compiled the file here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ihpA_zePE5S-xA8eVITEDCuWCHJCWCtI/view?usp=sharing)<br>- Culture and values copy needs to change to DB Dental (https://cbo.d.pr/jiOry0)<br>- Gordon's quote needs to say National Dental Care / DB Dental. (https://cbo.d.pr/Wsu461)<br>- Gordon's quote should say DB Dental Clinical Advisory Committee - we recently changed the name. https://cbo.d.pr/1PFUC1<br>- The contact us map needs to be the DB Dental head office - DB Dental Group Cnr Tydeman &amp; Pensioner Guard Rds, NORTH FREMANTLE WA 6159<br>- Under FAQs, please change the copy to say DB Dental.<br>- Change OUR STORY copy to the below:<br><br><strong>Our Story</strong><br><br>DB Dental is a successful dental practice group with one goal: to set the benchmark in providing our patients with the best available oral health services on the west coast.<br><br>Founded in 1987, DB Dental has grown from one practice to 18, located across regional and metropolitan Perth.

I had to get clarification from the client what they wanted to with the testimonials section because she had multiple testimonies per role on the document. So what we clarified was she wanted to have multiple testimonies scrolling in each role, exactly like what you did with PRACTICE STAFF https://cbo.d.pr/J1Dtgu. She also wanted automatic scrolling (9 seconds per testimony).<br><br>She still has to update us with testimonies but if we can update (add/remove/edit) the testimonies ourselves, we can go ahead with coding DB Dental. Let me know if this is possible.<br><br>Thanks Heath.<br><br><br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=\"http://l.cbo.me/l\"><img alt=\"CBO\" width=\"70\" height=\"70\" border=\"0\" style=\"width:70px;height:70px;\" src=\"https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cbo-signature/logo.png\"/></a><br><br><br><br><br><strong>William Yap</strong><br>Senior Marketing Manager<br><br><br>P: 1300 660 285 \u00b7 M: 0401 771 320<br><br><br>50 Miller St, North Sydney NSW 2060",

Just a note that one DA and 2 x hygienist testimonials are missing names but I'm waiting on those.<br><br>2) The yellow block with join national dental care just looks a little weird, can we do something different please? Something less blocky and more refined. No white text on yellow background please.<br><br>3) Can we change 850 staff to 1,000 staff?<br><br>4) Can we extend the 'our story' section blue background to the width of the page?<br><br>5) FAQs, the top one is lorem ipsum - where did that come from?<br><br>6) Can we please change the text to <strong>Hygienist / OHT</strong> - https://cbo.d.pr/xvLdP1<br><br><br>For DB Dental specifically:<br>1) Please find attached the testimonials for DB Dental (you already have one of Nikki smiling on NDC).<br><br>Thank you<br><br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=\"http://l.cbo.me/l\"><img alt=\"CBO\" width=\"70\" height=\"70\" border=\"0\" style=\"width:70px;height:70px;\" src=\"https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cbo-signature/logo.png\"/></a><br><br><br><br><br><strong>William Yap</strong><br>Senior Marketing Manager<br><br><br>P: 1300 660 285 \u00b7 M: 0401 771 320<br><br><br>13/333 George St, Sydney NSW 2000",
