This amount was not covered by our Health care BUPA due to your system calling my wife in 1 month too early.. This leaves us out of pocket $146.70 thanks to your system sending reminders to get booked in for a teeth clean... Whilst you can place the blame back on my wife for making the booking, the fact is she TRUSTED DB dental to do the right thing by her i.e. why would you send reminders before the due date??? This trust is now broken, whilst she might not have shown it to the front desk receptionist, she was livid.<br>\nI find the total situation unacceptable, she has been going to your practice for years (along with our children) all the way from Wanneroo however I have now stated to her, we need to find a new dental practitioners for our family.<br>\nIt's over to you to make amends here in my view, other than that, I will ensure all 4 family members look for another provider for all dental needs.<br>\nKind regards<br>\nDeane Palmer </p>\n</div>\n</div>",
