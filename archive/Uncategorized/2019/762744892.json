We have been working on the site to get a few performance gains.\u00a0<br /><br />The PageSpeed score, in particular for mobile has risen from around 12 to 32, here is a link: <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecsservicesnsw.com.au%2F&amp;tab=mobile\">https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecsservicesnsw.com.au%2F&amp;tab=mobile</a><br /><br />I will point out that although the PageSpeed tool implies that this score is the 'speed' of your website, it's actually a series of tests that are run to determine the theoretical performance of the website. The algorithm they use is questionable as it bases the performance on using an older model Motorola device with a slow 3G connection. This scenario is highly unlikely in our local market. It should be used a reference point for potential improvements, but not the 'be-all-and-end-all' if that makes sense? There are a lot of instances that if you try to score closer to 100/100 the net result is ironically a slower website.\u00a0<br /><br />A more realistic tool that is an industry standard to measure a sites performance is Pingdom and GTMetrix. These test the site in a more real-world scenario. As long as the site is loading in under 3secs from Pingdom, you are fine. In its ranking algorithm Google uses true speed versus the PageSpeed score if that makes sense.\u00a0<br /><br />With Pingdom the site is loading in around 2 - 2.2 secs, which is great for this type of website https://tools.pingdom.com/#5a300ff778800000 and you are getting a score of 93% through GTMetrix, using a more real-world scenario and tested from Sydney <a href=\"https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.ecsservicesnsw.com.au/BIKnO0aF\">https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.ecsservicesnsw.com.au/BIKnO0aF</a> <br /><br />Hope this clarifies and let me know if you need any more info.\u00a0<br />",
