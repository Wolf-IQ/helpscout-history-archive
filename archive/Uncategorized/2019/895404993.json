List each stylist with website, logo and contact info and list the areas they work in.<br>2.     List each area i.e. Northern Beaches, then list each stylist with website, logo and contact info below.<br>I\u2019m leaning towards the first option so that the stylists contact details aren\u2019t repeated. I will send you an excel document in a separate email with their details. I would like to be able to edit the stylist details and add / remove people down the track.<br>If you would like to become one of our styling partners please contact us to find out more.<br><br><br>I think that is it for now.<br><br>Thanks Heath.<br>Kind Regards<br>Amy Smith<br><br><br>AMY SMITH<br>CEO - HUNTLEY + CO &lt;https://huntleyandco.com.au/&gt;<br>E.
