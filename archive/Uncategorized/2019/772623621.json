Both events are free and both will<br>take place in the hospitals state-of-the-art rehabilitation facility \u2013 Lakeview Rehabilitation.<br><br>\u201cWe are only too happy to support the local senior\u2019s community during this very special week,\u201d said Kris Lukjanenko,<br>Manager of Lakeview Rehabilitation. \u201cWe will be delighted to welcome not just seniors themselves but everyone involved<br>in their care to our unique facility so they can see at first hand the benefits it provides for the community.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSince we were established, Lakeview Rehabilitation has gained an unrivalled reputation as one of the most advanced<br>rehabilitation facilities in Australia,\u201d continues Lukjanenko. \u201cWe not only have the latest in rehabilitation equipment,<br>a gymnasium that is truly state-of-the-art, an excellent hydrotherapy pool and spa, but a team of outstanding and compassionate<br>rehabilitation specialists who have been hand-picked and are committed to delivering the best possible care.\u201d<br><br>The Falls Prevention event will take place on the morning of Wednesday, 20th February 2019 and is limited to 16 attendees.<br>\u201cThe morning is essential for those who suffer from falling over (or have concerns about the risk) and for those who care for them,\u201d<br>explains Lukjanenko. \u201cThe morning will be hosted by our excellent Physiotherapists and Occupational Therapists who will talk<br>attendees through essential things to be aware of both at home and in residential care facilities.
