We removed the read more button from the accessories and bed linen (as there was nothing more to read!) but it looks like it\u2019s also removed from the furniture. Can we please add that back in.<br>On both the main site and the RFP there are no images of beds. Is this something I can add? If so, where from?<br>Are we able to pretty up the PDF that the client is sent<br>Can the email have a footer with our contact details, logo etc.<br>Can we add contact info on the actual PDF (like a footer at the end of the page) and maybe some text.
