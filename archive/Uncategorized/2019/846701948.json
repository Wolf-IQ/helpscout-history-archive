I\u2019ve had a good play around, here is my feedback:<br>&gt; Can we change the name from catalogue to products. We are worried that catalogue sounds too static. Thoughts?<br>&gt; I would like to consolidate the list in the room drop downs. For example, instead of having single headboard, double headboard, queen headboard etc it would simply say \u201cheadboard\u201d. The same for beds, dining tables, sofas, etc etc. Basically that drop down list would be very simplified. I know that is different to how things are set up at the moment. It would mean that there is a sub folder for certain categories between the parent and the child. Too complicated or ok?<br>&gt; When you are looking at the child category I think we need an \u201cadd to cart button\u201d. Would it be possible to make the \u201cread more\u201d button a pop up (like quick view currently is) and remove \u201cquick view\u201d? I\u2019d love to do this for the main site too please.<br>&gt; Can we please change the words on each of the parent categories to plural i.e. sofas, bedside tables etc etc so that it is clear we have more than one of each item. I\u2019d love to do this for the main site too please.<br>&gt; When you are in the child item and you increase the quantity should the price per week change? If we can\u2019t do that should we say \u201cprice per week per items)<br>&gt; I think we need all of the access and deliver info on this page (the same as the main site)<br>&gt; The delivery costs in the T\u2019s + C\u2019s are still the old price brackets.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I will work on the copy for the welcome page and send you the images for the gallery.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; There is one other aspect I would like to discuss around the different user profiles. Can you please call me when you are free to discuss.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Can you please also confirm what the cost is for this site.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Thank you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Kind Regards<br>&gt; Amy Smith<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; AMY SMITH<br>&gt; CEO - HUNTLEY + CO &lt;https://huntleyandco.com.au/&gt;<br>&gt; E.
