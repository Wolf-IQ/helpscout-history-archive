They offer a better level of compression, different resolutions depending on your connection, buffering techniques, packets and parsing etc.\u00a0</li><li>For publicly available videos, you double your chances of them being seen and found online\u00a0</li><li>They make it harder (but not impossible) to download copies of the video</li><li>It creates a handy catalogue of all videos the clients has accumulated over time, versus trawling through the WP Media section</li><li>Saves server space and reduces resources for not only page loads but backups and restores, migrations etc.\u00a0</li></ul><br />I hope that helps... For what it's worth, I setup a business Vimeo account for our higher end WolfIQ clients a few years back and it's my go to for this exact problem. But, I would recommend the client setup their own account (or you do it on their behalf) to create that 'online video catalogue' of sorts. You have full granular control that way.",
