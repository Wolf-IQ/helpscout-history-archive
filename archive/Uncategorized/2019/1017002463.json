Clinical handover takes place whenever there is a transition in care. A standardised approach is used which facilitatessafe and accurate communication and coordination of care.<br><br>\nBedside handover occurs at least once every 24 hours. Patients are encouraged to ask questions so that they are informed about their medical condition, about the care they are receiving and their care options. With your consent, we are happy for loved ones/carers to be present during bedside handover. Bedside handover provides staff with the opportunity to work in partnership with their patients so that information can be validated and clarified with patients/carers as required. Patient goals and preferences are also considered. <br><br>\nDuring the bedside handover process, staff will also be performing a safety scan of the patient room to ensure the patient's call bell and mobility aids are within reach.<br><span style=\"color:#1F497D;\"></span><p></p><br><span style=\"color:#1F497D;\"></span><p></p><br><span style=\"color:#1F497D;\">SECONDLY:</span><br><span style=\"color:#1F497D;\"></span><p></p><br><span style=\"color:#1F497D;\">In FOR PATIENTS -&gt; DISCHARGE FROM HOSPITAL</span><br><span style=\"color:#1F497D;\"></span><p></p><br><span style=\"color:#1F497D;\">Please change the content to:</span><br><span style=\"color:#1F497D;\"></span><p></p><br>\nOur multidisciplinary team ensure a safe, well-coordinated discharge.
