This primarily impacted system generated or admin generated passwords intended for one-time use.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; We have reviewed the login information for the user account(s) and have found no evidence that the unhashed passwords were misused.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The following is the list of users impacted in your domain(s):<br>&gt;<br>&gt; teneille@entcaresydney.com.au<br>&gt; Google Planned Action: for your security, starting tomorrow Wednesday May 22, 2019 PT we will force a password change unless it has already been changed prior to that time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Our password update methodology is as follows:<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Users With Single Sign On: We will reset their password by changing it to a randomly generated secure value. Please note that this will have no effect on their ability to log in using their Single Sign On credentials.<br>&gt; Other Users and Super Admins: We will terminate their sessions and prompt users to change their password at their next login.<br>&gt; In addition, starting Wednesday, May 29, 2019 PT we will reset the password for users that have not yet selected a new password or have not had a password reset. These users will need to follow your organization\u2019s password recovery process. Super Admins will not be impacted. For information on password recovery options please refer to the following Help Center Article.<br>&gt; For further questions please contact Google Support and reference issue number 131082029.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Sincerely,<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The G Suite Team<br>&gt;<br>&gt; \u00a9 2019  Google LLC 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You have received this important update about your G Suite account because you designated this email address as a primary or secondary contact for mandatory service communications in your Google Admin console profile.",
