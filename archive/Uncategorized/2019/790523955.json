We made an image for a video, added the audio track and then rendered in out as a video file and added to your Vimeo account. This way it\u2019s secure and can\u2019t be downloaded as well. I think it\u2019s a good solution, let me know if it\u2019s ok with you both?<br><br>Thanks and speak soon,",
