From the team at Huntley + Co (let\u2019s use that exact text in the email body too please).<br>In the \u201capply now\u201d page, can we please add another 2 compulsory fields.<br>How long would you like to hire our products for? (and have a free text filed).<br><br>Also, a couple of point on the main site:<br>For some reason when I log in the \u201cDashboard\u201d now says \u201cQuotes\u201d. I think it still says \u201cDashboard\u201d on my clients page. Can we revert back to \u201cDashboard\u201d please (it was quotes when we first built the site but we changed it to Dashboard).<br>Can we please add the gallery (i.e. insta page) to the main site.<br>Also, I was hoping to talk to you about the pricing and how the discount coupon is applied. Can you please call me when you are free.<br><br>And also the home page, not logged in part (what is that called???)<br>The Instagram button (the camera) at the bottom isn\u2019t working<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Kind Regards<br>Amy Smith<br><br><br>AMY SMITH<br>CEO - HUNTLEY + CO &lt;https://huntleyandco.com.au/&gt;<br>E.
