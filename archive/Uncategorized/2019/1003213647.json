We can make so with the platform as it is this year because there are only a few weeks left of offering free extension until sold. We can tackle this next year.<br /><br />In terms of the google API, I\u2019m hearing you. I\u2019m surprised that there hasn\u2019t been pressure on them to get this right - we can\u2019t be the only business relying on this field? The weird thing is that it finds the right unit and unit number but when you select it, it forgets the unit number (hence I assumed it could have something to do with the coding as the api seems to work). Not an issue mate, we will continue with the workaround.\u00a0<br /><br />Dan\u00a0<br />",

We need it to stay on the paperwork, but can we perhaps put a horizontal strike through on it?<br /><br />(6) It is doing this weird thing with Tamara\u2019s IPAD where if she stays on Tab 4 for a long time then it freezes her out or when she puts on an extra pre-filled room, it pushes them up into the room above! See attached screenshot showing an example. Is it perhaps a fix to autosave after say 5 minutes?<br /><br />\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00a0<br /><br /><strong><u>EXPLANTION\u00a0</u></strong><br /><br />(3) The auto populate address field doesn\u2019t work too well when it comes to units. For example, if you type in 4/27 York St, Sydney, the it autopopulates 27 York St Sydney but leaves out the unit number? Is there any chance we can fix this?<br />Answer: we have previously discussed this\u2026 it\u2019s basically down to the Google API that we are using to lookup addresses. Please note, this is a different dataset to the one that\u2019s available in the publicly listed Google Maps. So essentially we are at their mercy on this one.<br /><br />\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00a0<br /><br /><strong><u>ADDITIONS</u></strong>\u00a0- these are going to take an estimate 8hrs to build\u00a0<br /><br />(1) On Tab 2 Agent Details, we have never had a field with \u201cAgent Phone Number\u201d. Is it possible to add one please? It can go to the right of the \u201cAgent Email\u201d box.<br /><br />(2) How difficult would it be for us to have an agent database that sits in the background that we populate. That way, each time someone starts typing in an agent name, they can select the name from a pre-defined list and upon selection, there is an automatic population of agency, email address and phone number. This would save our operators lots of time filling this out. Not so much of an issue on a PC because Google Chrome seems to remember fields, but on the IpAD these fields are constantly being done from scratch.<br /><br />(4) This is probably not an easy one \u2013 sometimes we need to move a room up from optional extras into the main quote or visa versa. We hoped to just be able to drag it down under optional extras line (or visa versa) but alas it doesn\u2019t work \u2639. Any quick way we can re-assign an optional extra room into the main quote without having to redo the entire room?<br /><br />(7) Creating a template. This is a great function but after a while, the template gets pushed down and down into the platform so you have to go onto that second or third page to find them. Any way we can keep the templated homes more easily accessible?<br /><br />(8) Style Until it Sells. We are offering an end of year special which is basically if you style for 4 weeks, you get unlimited free weeks after that until the home sells. We only offer this on vacant properties that are marketed in December etc so the eligibility of it is limited. Currently it\u2019s difficult to express this in the quote though. So I was thinking we could have an additional field in the \u2018FREE WEEKS\u2019 dropdown that said \u201cFree Till Sold\u201d or something similar and then if it was selected, the free weeks would read : Proposal includes 4 weeks, delivery, styling and collection. Subsequent week to week rental is FREE until the property is sold (subject to Ts and Cs).\u201d The part in red would substitute the current script which simply says how many free weeks you get based on the selection.<br /><br />\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u00a0<br /><br />We will commence on items 5 and 6 this week. Please let us know if we are clear to start the Additions items too.\u00a0<br /><br />Thanks and speak soon,\u00a0<br /><br /><br /><div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>",

            "body": "Hi Heath<br><br>As discussed earlier, it would be good to find 10 minutes on Monday to walk you through some of these bugs and tweaks we would like to address with the quote platform. In advance of that, I\u2019ve had a go at summarising below.<br><br>On Tab 2 Agent Details, we have never had a field with \u201cAgent Phone Number\u201d. Is it possible to add one please? It can go to the right of the \u201cAgent Email\u201d box.<br>How difficult would it be for us to have an agent database that sits in the background that we populate. That way, each time someone starts typing in an agent name, they can select the name from a pre-defined list and upon selection, there is an automatic population of agency, email address and phone number. This would save our operators lots of time filling this out. Not so much of an issue on a PC because Google Chrome seems to remember fields, but on the IpAD these fields are constantly being done from scratch.<br>The auto populate address field doesn\u2019t work too well when it comes to units. For example, if you type in 4/27 York St, Sydney, the it autopopulates 27 York St Sydney but leaves out the unit number? Is there any chance we can fix this?<br>This is probably not an easy one \u2013 sometimes we need to move a room up from optional extras into the main quote or visa versa. We hoped to just be able to drag it down under optional extras line (or visa versa) but alas it doesn\u2019t work \u2639. Any quick way we can re-assign an optional extra room into the main quote without having to redo the entire room?<br>The stylists are sometimes missing in the word document the fact that the optional extras HAS NOT been selected. We need it to stay on the paperwork, but can we perhaps put a horizontal strike through on it?<br>It is doing this weird thing with Tamara\u2019s IPAD where if she stays on Tab 4 for a long time then it freezes her out or when she puts on an extra pre-filled room, it pushes them up into the room above! See attached screenshot showing an example. Is it perhaps a fix to autosave after say 5 minutes?<br>Creating a template. This is a great function but after a while, the template gets pushed down and down into the platform so you have to go onto that second or third page to find them. Any way we can keep the templated homes more easily accessible?<br>Style Until it Sells. We are offering an end of year special which is basically if you style for 4 weeks, you get unlimited free weeks after that until the home sells. We only offer this on vacant properties that are marketed in December etc so the eligibility of it is limited. Currently it\u2019s difficult to express this in the quote though. So I was thinking we could have an additional field in the \u2018FREE WEEKS\u2019 dropdown that said \u201cFree Till Sold\u201d or something similar and then if it was selected, the free weeks would read : Proposal includes 4 weeks, delivery, styling and collection. Subsequent week to week rental is FREE until the property is sold (subject to Ts and Cs).\u201d  The part in red would substitute the current script which simply says how many free weeks you get based on the selection.<br><br>Look forward to discussing next week.<br><br>Have a great weekend!<br><br>Dan<br><br><br>Dan Gerber<br>Managing Director<br>Advantage Property Styling<br><br>Follow us on:<br>&lt;https://www.facebook.com/AdvantageStyling/&gt;  &lt;https://www.instagram.com/advantagestyling/&gt;  &lt;&gt;<br><br>M 0412 955 531 | P 02 9310 1611<br>Tenancy 1, Unit 1, 14A Baker Street, BANKSMEADOW NSW 2019<br>www.advantagestyling.com.au &lt;http://www.advantagestyling.com.au/&gt;<br><br>&lt;https://advantagestyling.com.au/&gt;",
