Great news, I can confirm your<strong> westcoat.au</strong> domain name is all set up and redirecting to your primary website: <strong>\u00a0westcoat.com.au</strong><br /><br /><strong>What now?<br /></strong><br />Nothing changes for now, it's business as usual, however your domain and brand is now protected. In the coming months, you may choose to use the\u00a0<strong>westcoat.au</strong> domain on marketing etc. as it is shorter. However, we advise our clients to sit tight for the moment while the market gets used to the new, complimentary Australian domain name structure.\u00a0<br /><br />Let us know if you have any questions.",
