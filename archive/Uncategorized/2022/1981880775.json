All Australian businesses that hold a <strong>.com.au</strong> or <strong>net.au</strong> domain name are being encouraged to register and secure their equivalent .au domain to protect their brand.<br /><br />As a registered owner of an Australian domain name, you have the first opportunity to secure the .au equivalent of your domain.<br /><br /><strong>You have until 20 Sept 2022</strong> to take action, after which your .au domain name equivalent will be made publicly available for anyone to purchase. The main risk here is a competitor purchasing your .au domain name and holding it for their own benefit.\u00a0<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><strong>Please visit our article written by Heath, for the full details and recommendations:<br /></strong><a href=\"https://wolfiq.com.au/to-au-or-not-au-that-is-the-question/\"><strong>https://wolfiq.com.au/to-au-or-not-au-that-is-the-question/</strong></a><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />As with most things like this, we recommend you don't leave it to the last moment to take action.<br /><br />And of course, feel free to reply to this email with any questions.<br /><br />Thanks and speak soon,",
