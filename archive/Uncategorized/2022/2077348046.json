            "body": "Good morning all,<br><br>Something to point out here as too many external people have involved on this attack but internal staffs actually know more details. From Sean's email advising me yesterday 4:21pm to contact Commweb to change online platform back to \"live\" instead of \"test/suspend\" status, I just realised Wolf IQ has started this Captcha version upgrade on Wed morning. However up till yesterday 5PM our central res team still received customers complaint calls after trying many times wanting to buy giftcards online but of course \"failed\" because Commweb told me on Thursday morning when I called them without knowing someone have been working on this the day before our online platform has been suspended, thus no more attack., not because of no failures since he upgraded to version 3.<br><br>Adrian: if you look at our online deposit platform how many deposit we've been receiving in FULL amount daily promptly, and if you knew about how often our staffs at venues/central res teams accidentally charged wrong when cancelling/changing venues, and if you know the days Stripe delayed payment plus every single deposit they took commissions, you would not suggest Stripe. CBA's online deposit platform has no issues to accounts team over past 10 years considering cyber security has been often upgraded/maintained. CBA has been suggesting 3D secure to prevent this happened for 10 years now, but our group still hasn't agreed to it. The <strong>Captcha</strong> option to add on was also from my email in Jan 2021 after that famous thousands attack.<br><br>I've informed Commweb after 4:30PM as soon as my email reporting customers complaint then received Sean's email to contact Commweb. Up till now just so you know our online gift card platform is still under \"suspended/test\" status - thus no more attack, I'll inform you all once confirmed reply received from Commweb.<br><br><strong>Best regards,</strong><br><br><br><br><strong>Shirley</strong>",
